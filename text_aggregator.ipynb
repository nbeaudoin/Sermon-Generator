Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n                         A DEEPER HOSPITALITY\\n\\t\\n\\tThe New Testament part of our Bible contains such a mix of teachings, stories and letters that it can get confusing where we are when, on any given Sunday morning.  Written at various points during the first century CE, our present day New Testament has been re-translated and the collection has been re-shaped up to the 21st century.  It gives us a sometimes perplexing view into a world very different from our own; a world where the realm of things unseen is taken for granted; a world where people like Paul and his companion missionaries expectedly traveled all over the place; a world where the overarching control of the Roman empire is simply hard for us to imagine.  It takes focus and openness and diligence to get into the texts and to root around.  What is here for us today, as we move through challenging transitions of our own lives and the changes in our congregation?\\n\\tThis section from the Gospel of John is a goodbye message in which we find a strange combination of sadness and hopefulness. The setting is a private room in Jerusalem where Jesus’ shares his last supper with his closest friends and students.  John describes Jesus as trying to explain to his followers that he has to depart.  They will no longer have him in their lives.  They will have to go on with their outreach ministry without him…and yet, and yet, they will not be alone.  If Jesus sounds a bit ambiguous here, well…he is talking about something that is actually quite ambiguous.  Jesus gone, dead, not here; Jesus here in a different way….? \\n“Are you going to be here with us or not, Jesus?”  we might well have inquired, if we had been sitting at that table. Jesus goes on to describe how God will send a comforter, an advocate, the Holy Spirit that will fill them and guide them.  He gives his listeners this tender image of he and God coming to them and making “our home with them.”  Such curious symbolic language – Jesus and God setting up homemaking in their followers.\\nThe church has preserved these ancient words, down through the centuries.  It is mysterious language, language which I believe is symbolic of an unseen reality that permeates our lives as followers of Jesus.   God and the spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, taking up residence in us as we “keep” Jesus’ words.  You and I are the home, homes, essentially, of the Creator of the Universe. Ponder that as you walk around this week.  I am the home of the Creator of the Universe.  And that person is also the home of the Creator of the Univese!  I don’t take this to mean we are God’s only home; what is suggested here is simply that God and the Risen Jesus Christ take up residence in us.  How are we to make sense of this?   \\nTo explain what this is like, Jesus uses the mysterious metaphor of “the Advocate,” the companionship of the Holy Spirit.  “God will send the Holy Spirit in my name,” explains Jesus, “and the Spirit will teach you everything and remind you of all that I have said to you.”  Here’s the question for each of us: How hospitable am I to divine guidance making a home in me?  Am I open to direction beyond my own good thinking, when Plan A doesn’t make sense anymore and even Plan B falters?  \\n\\tIn this story from Acts we find one of Jesus’ closest followers, Peter, the one who denied knowing Jesus when pressed by Roman guards.  Transformed to his core through his experiences with the Risen Jesus, Peter now travels the region to share the Good News that such change of heart and mind is possible.  In today’s story, Peter and his fellow travelers hopscotch up the western coast of the Aegan sea and end up to Philippi, leading city of then Macedonia, current day Greece.  They hang out for a few days; nothing much seems to happen.  On the Sabbath day of rest and worship, they hear of others who gather down at the nearby river for prayer.  Is it a synagogue or just an outdoor worship spot?  Anyone else besides this group of women there?  Not sure.  But what emerges is this curious detail about another sojourner not unlike themselves:  A traveling tradeswoman named Lydia, a dealer in rare and precious purple cloth, originally from the city of Thyatira (back over on the other side of the Aegaen Sea, in Asia Minor).   Notice how she is named, which is rare for women in the hugely patriarchal Biblical tradition.  Feminist scholarship in the last few decades has revealed that women like Lydia were quite prominent in the early church, and were more instrumental than history has led us to believe, as both missionaries and preachers of the Gospel.  \\n\\tIn this text, Lydia is described as a “God fearer” which means she was probably an educated, Hellenized Greek, a sophisticated urban person, who found the ethical teachings and monotheism of Judaism to be compelling.  It was not uncommon for women of means to hold gatherings of prevailing religious movements in their homes, be they the cult of Dionysus or the early Christian house meetings.  We learn here that God opens her heart as she listens to Paul talk about Jesus, and his way of compassion and justice for all.  She is profoundly moved.  She owns a large home in the city, as indicated by her whole “household” (relatives, servants, etc) being baptized along with her.  And here’s where I think the author of Acts wants us to pay attention, because this “foreigner,” outsider to the faith, enacts an essential principal of the Jewish Torah and of Jesus’ ministry:  hospitality to the stranger.  She implores Paul and his company to come stay at her home.  God makes a home in her, and she responds with radical hospitality.  She opens her home, her resources, her heart to strangers.   She is an outsider to the Jewish faith, but seems to understand intuitively a central aspect of Jewish spiritual practice: hospitality to “the stranger who sojourns with you in your land” as described in, the Book of Jewish Law in our Old Testament book of Leviticus.  \\n\\tI believe true hospitality is a central challenge to the contemporary church.  I’m not talking just tea, cookies and bars here.  The essential hospitality question that should be addressed in the any interim period is: who is our neighbor now?  Are we paying attention to our current neighbors in the way Jesus defined neighbor: the person we don’t expect to connect with, the outsider, the stranger, in our midst or just outside our doors?  Who are the sojourners in our midst, that God desires us to draw into a deeper experience of God’s hospitality, God’s grace, God’s extravagant welcome?  What kind of inner openness and compassion do we need to nourish in ourselves so we can extend this hospitality?  I find that I need to run under more than my own steam to do this.\\t \\nHenry Nouwen, the 20th century Catholic priest and theologian, writes in his slim and haunting book, The Way of the Heart, about this active presence of God finding a home in us.  He speaks about how we can “slowly build a little nest” of prayer and openness for God inside of us.  It’s as though the words of simple prayer, even \\nslowly repeated short phrase such as “God, I wondering about you,” or “Spirit, are you there?” or “Open my heart,” build a nest.   Help! Thanks! Wow! as Anne Lamott would say it more bluntly (“Help Thanks Wow: The Three Essential Prayers). These daily, simple prayers “slowly build a little nest for themselves in our heart and stay there for the rest of our busy day.  Even while we are talking, studying, commuting, gardening, or building,” even sleeping, writes Nouwen, “the prayer can continue in our heart and keep us aware of God’s ever-present guidance” (p. 82, The Way of the Heart).\\nMaybe this is the part that is our job:  slowly building this nest inside, stick by twig, fiber by feather, prayer by prayer.  Maybe this is the essential job of the church: to help us individually and communally build a nest to receive the living presence of God.  Not so we can just sit cozy and chummy with God and our favorite friends, happy in our own little nest.  We build and learn to dwell in the nest so openness and compassion can grow in us. And that will compel us to reach out to our hurting world is new, courageous new ways.  Welcoming God’s indwelling within our hearts may be the key to opening our spaces, our resources to the strangers among us.   Down by the river, outside the ancient city of Phillipi, Lydia welcomed God’s spirit into her heart and gospel-preaching strangers into her home.  God deeply longs to settle in the nest of our hearts and create the new within us.  That is Good News.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.      \\t\\n(We join together in a time of silent reflection…..)\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTRANSFORMATIVE ENCOUNTERS\\n\\n\\tOur Exodus text and this story from Luke both have an other-worldly feel to them.  They describe mysterious scenes of encounters with the divine that may be, frankly, hard for us to imagine.  God is portrayed as an awe-inspiring glory and over-whelming presence; even God’s messengers take on super-human radiance.  Subsequent verses in Exodus will describe Moses’ luminous face lit from within, requiring a veil so as to not frighten the people of Israel.  Matthew tells of a shift in Jesus’ countenance as he prays; his robes turns a dazzling white; two famous people we know are already dead appear at his side.  Almost sounds like scenes from a B movie!  My eyes reflexively squint as I try to imagine these scenes.  How do we as 21st century people, who don’t regularly see scenes like this except in B movies, engage these texts?  And what do we do with these narratives seem filled with bizarre, perhaps overwrought visions. How might they guide us in this transition period at this church, as we seek to better understand God’s reality and purposes for this congregation? \\n\\tA group of us have been reading and discussing Cynthia Bourgeault’s book, The Wisdom Jesus: A New Perspective on Christ and His Message.   Episcopal priest, mystic and contemplative author, she has presented some real challenges to our group.  Claiming that Jesus came as not so much savior of sinful people but as a life-giver.  As a teacher of the transformation of human consciousness.  And that in following Jesus, we are not so much striving to be good people, but to let the very way our brain operates to be changed, transformed.  Only with that shift in perspective, change of our mental operating systems as she describes it, are we be able to make choices and do the actions of helping humanity that are not based in our own needs for esteem, safety and control.    Bourgeault claims that this is what Jesus meant when he talked about the Kingdom of God, the reign of God is both around and within you.  Open to it!\\n\\tPondering all this, I’ve been wondering what these stories about Moses and then Jesus, each interacting with the divine, have to say about our own inner transformation as Christians.   Why are they included in scripture?  And specifically, what was Jesus doing taking those 3 disciples up to the top of the mountain?  What did he want them to experience and to know deep in their bones?  \\n\\tBiblical scholars have noted that scripture seems to present us with two different ways of relating to God.  One is knowing God in a place.  The other is more connected to knowing God on a journey, on the move. ( “Listening to God: Spiritual Formation in Congregations,” by John Ackerman).  These appear to be both ancient patterns, sometimes called habitation/dwelling spirituality and journey/seeking spirituality.  Think about this for a moment: where do you find you experience God most clearly:  in certain places?  These could be anything from a temple to a church to more ancient religious sites like a grove of sacred trees.  Like religions around the world that have holy places, holy buildings, Jews eventually constructed the Temple in Jerusalem and speak of finding God in it’s inner sanctum, in the Holy of Holies.  Place can give us a sense of belonging to tribe or congregation, our place of worship being a safe haven where we can find answers to life’s perplexing questions, God as “a mighty fortress,” “ the rock of ages,” the refuge to which we can flee.  \\nNot having such a “place,” was the experience of the Israelites fleeing Egypt and then struggling to face the unknown as they traveled through the wilderness:  So often they longed for their previous lives, for their home in Egypt.   I wonder if the small group of disciples, Invited to come up to this lonely mountain with Jesus for prayer, may have been in much the same emotional space.   “Jesus, this is truly amazing!  You, Moses, Elijah.  It’s so good to be here; can’t we have a building campaign, build some cool structures and just stay here with you?”  That yearning for place, a spirituality focused on a habitation, can be strong.\\n\\tBut Jesus seemed to have something else in mind, and it seems to point .   more to a spirituality found in the journey, often a journey through difficult places and times.  Perhaps the disciples are getting a hint of what is coming next for Jesus at this point.  It is midpoint in his ministry and Jesus has begun to talk with them about the fact that he is going to go to Jerusalem.  Going to the huge capital city even though it is dangerous for him.  Even though he will suffer at the hands of the religious and political authorities and he will die.   Like Israelites wandering in the wilderness, the disciples don’t really know when or where they will be led.   Hearing Jesus talk about self-emptying, dying to self, loosing one’s life to find it, has been confusing for the disciples.   Only days before, Jesus warned them of his own death and even their own possible suffering in following him.  Where’s the reassurance and comfort in all this, they may well have asked each other.  When Jesus invites a few of them for a time of private retreat and reflection on top of a mountain, they are blown away by the scene that unfolds before them.  It isn’t surprising that the disciples press for a new habitation, a place to memorialize this amazing spectical:  Jesus glowing radiant and bright, Moses there representing God’s law to the Jews and Elijah the Jewish prophetic tradition; all are right there with him, symbolizing the whole known Hebrew scripture in Jesus’ time.  of a radiant Jesus, flanked by the law-giver Moses and the prophet Elijah.  They will yearn for a “dwelling spirituality” (Ackerman would describe it).  Better to stay and commemorate a glorious past with shelters, booths to commemorate, to institutionalize, what they have seen.  “Rabbi,” cries Peter: “it is good for us to be here; let us make three dwellings, one for you, one for Moses, and one for Elijah!”  \\n\\tBut a cloud overcomes them and they hear a voice: “This is my beloved son” – same words as after Jesus is baptized, but with an addition – “This is my Beloved, listen to him!”  And “suddenly when they looked around, they saw no one with them any more, but only Jesus.”  And immediately they are on the move again, following this one back into the teeming crowds, the healings and preaching, the impending confrontations with the authorities.\\nJesus would not let them stay there.  Which makes me wonder:  where does Jesus call us out?  Where does he not want us to stay any longer as church?  I’m not suggesting abandoning this building, but are there habitations of traditions, of comfort and reassurance, ways of being together that keep us from this journey with Jesus?  Keep us from more fully comprehending where the spirit of the Living Jesus leads next?  \\nAs the scene changes on the mountaintop, and there is regularly old Jesus in his dingy travel robe and sandals, all radiance disippated.  What do the disciples hear?   Keep an ear open to “my beloved Son.”    “Listen” to him.  The presence of Jesus challenges us to another way of being together.  We are to make decisions together because we are listening to Jesus, not to our preferences.  We are to let his vision transform us and inspire us to do things in different ways because following him leads that way.  This means that when it comes to a church vote about something, members are not being asked what their preference would be.  They are being asked which church practice or activity will more faithfully fulfill the current vision and mission of the church.  \\nI also think this invitation to listen to Jesus may be the most important thing we as s church offer to the world.  Come, we don’t give you all the answers, but we will journey with you as together we listen to Jesus.  As we listen to something that is not just us and our own best ideas.  Join us as we will search the scriptures, pay attention to the needs of the world, and prayerfully discern God’s leading together.  The challenge for any congregation is that our dwelling, our place, our rootedness in our traditions together often become our primary focus.  The tension between church being a safe haven and church being a disciple-ship school will always be there.   Today’s texts invite us down from tendency to “build booths,” to only memorize a beloved past.  As John Ackerman observes, “spiritual formation happens when individuals and congregations together can listen to God, obey God, and be transformed by God.”  \\n\\tAnd so we keep listening together as we enter this season of Lent, spiraling back around to this reflective period in the church year in yet a different place as a congregation.  How blessed we are to be together in a church that is not just “building booths” to memorialize the mountain-top past but is moving bravely into God’s future together.   Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n\\t\\n\\t\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTHE CLASSROOM OF WISDOM\\n\\n\\tSometimes we are offered an odd scrap of scripture, such as this piece from Proverbs, that doesn’t seem to make much sense in our 21st century lives.  Why do we need etiquitte advice about coming into a king’s presence or standing in the place of the great?  When was the last time you bumped into someone really powerful or famous?  As I consider this Proverbs passage, I keep flashing on royal court scenes from “Game of Thrones.” Is this advice about humility, or simply self-survival in the presence of unpredictable leader elite?   And what do we make of this curious dinner table scene from the Gospel of Luke?  Is Jesus continuing the humility advice from Proverbs, or offering a bizarre suggestion on how to assemble a party guest list?  Humility in the face of priviledge and power, decisions about who we are to associate with and why….how do we make sense out of all this?\\n\\tThe Book of Proverbs is collection of practical advice from all over the ancient near East, and was assembled probably around the 6th through 5th century BCE.  This Biblical material is old….but is it durable, relevant for our world where we don’t even have kings and queens, much less have opportunity to be introduced into a royal court?!  Unlike other parts of the Hebrew Bible, Proverbs contains no direct divine speech, no legal codes, no any stories about Jewish history.  It’s just down-to-earth advice on how to live, how our characters are formed so we may make wise descisions and choices in our lives.  Much of it is aimed at the moral development of across the lifespan: like “hear, my child, your father’s instruction, and do not reject your mother’s teaching, for they are a fair garland for your head (Proverbs 1:8).”  “Do not be wise in your own eyes; but fear the LORD and turn away from evil.”  Unfortunately, many of us may associate Proverbs with priggish, uptight moralizing against all things fun and exciting, sort of like our Puritan ancestors on steroids.  And who wants to go around “fearing the LORD” anyway?  Frankly, I’ve never been interested in a God that I must approach with cringing terror.   The “fear of the LORD is the beginning of wisdom,” insists Proverbs.  What?   Jesus would have been steeped in knowledge of Proverbs from his study of Jewish scriptures, and he never seemed to “fear” God.  \\nBut it appears that our English translation for the word “fear” just doesn’t capture the original Hebrew. “Yirat Adonai,” fear of the LORD, in Hebrew, actually means awe, reverence, respect.  Not tremble-in-your-boots.  How does “having awe and reverence for God” connect with this advice about serving in a royal court?  Is our attitude towards God connected to how we are with other people?  There is something about humility in here, perhaps not assuming I have all the answers, or a place of priviledge and status.  For the authors of Proverbs, a sense of awe and reverence for God may have some connection with how I view others, and my behavior around other people.  \\n\\tReturning to Luke.  Once again, Jesus is sitting around having a meal with people.  But Jesus practices a strange sort of table manners.  He seems to be in a habit of offending his hosts, and in today’s passage from Luke he does it again. It’s dinner at the local legal experts’, the Pharisees, home, and on a Sabbath evening.  Jesus has just shocked and annoyed his host by curing some man who has wandered on to the scene.  The host’s consternation is not just about uptight legalism. The Sabbath day of rest was an important and vibrant spiritual practice for 1st century Jews.  Observing Sabbath traditions was a way of showing awe and respect for God.  It reminded them that they were human and not hardier than God, who symbolically “took a break” on the seventh day of Creation. Was Jesus flaunting this tradition? \\n\\tAt tonight’s banquet, Jesus pushes his challenge of the cultural norms..   Lavish dinners worldwide have been part of a social elites’ way of establishing power and maintaining connections with other elites. If you invited a fellow elite, that person would be obligated to repay you with a return invitation.   And, in both Jewish and Greco Roman societies of the time, the poor and the physically disabled or sick were to avoided at such gatherings, because of course, “they are not like us and we certainly don’t want to be like them.”  \\n\\tJesus notices the distinguished guests jockeying for position around the table, and admonishes them to take the lower place.  Well, isn’t that just common courtesy?  And they might even get the self-serving chance to be invited publicly to the table, notes Jesus.  (I can almost see him slyly smirk to himself as he suggests this).  “Oh, of course,” intone the dinner guests, “good suggestion, Jesus.”  Nevertheless, Jesus has suggested a stance of public humility, which was apparently a challenge for this crowd.\\n\\tBut then Jesus launches into this rather bizarre suggestion for his esteemed host:  the people you should really invite to your big party are the town low-life, all these marginalized losers.  And you will you be blessed for doing this!  Because they can’t repay you!   Jesus, has now entertwined humiity with a true hospitality challenge.  We are called to be more than friendly to those who are like you and can return the favor.  Our current immigration debate stirs in my brain.  Who do we welcome to our table?  I can hear this first century dinner  crowd begin to gumble, “I don’t know Jesus, I’m glad to try humility among my own crowd.  But maybe it is not wise to be that hospitable.”   \\n\\tOne of the Biblical commentators I read this week noted that the Book of Proverbs describes how the way to learn humility is all around us.  It’s like we live in a daily “classroom of wisdom” writes the Presbyterian minister and OT scholar , Anne Stewart  \\nHow easy to dismiss this as simply being a “goody two shoes,” a nice, polite person who steps back and doesn’t make waves.  But Stewart suggests that humility is probably the chief character virtue described in Proverbs and that we have ample opportunities to practice it everyday.  In traffic, in grocery store lines, during times of inconvenience and stress.  I find this challenging myself, because my day seems a lot easier if I don’t have to keep reflecting on what is happening inside me!  But again and again, Jesus leans into this Biblical tradition of acquiring wisdom in the daily classroom of life.  We are called to notice:  in a confusing or anxious situation, is it my ego need to be right that rules my responses?  Or do I pause for a moment before responding reactively?  How might I listen more closely to this other person before making a judgement?  What is God seeking to have me know in my moment of consternation?  Like the Pharisee’s dinner table guests, I seem to be invited again and again to humbly face my own priviledge: as an educated person, as a white person, as a person with access to adequate food, shelter and healthcare.  What assumptions and choices do I make out of this priviledge?\\nIt has struck me this week that practicing humility and hospitality isn’t just some self-improvement project.  Perhaps we start to listen to immigration stories differently, recognizing that Jesus would invite people different from us to the table of our lives.  We become humbly curious about people whose world views and experiences sharply contrast with our own.  We begin to stretch our imaginations to think about how the Kingdom of God, this welcome table, has to somehow include everyone.  We start talking together about how our actions, as individuals and as a church, might make an impact on stretching this countries welcome of immigrants and refugees.  And slowly, this kind of pondering changes us.  It enables us to be of even greater service in this audacious task of healing of the world.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nTHIS EASTER ENCOUNTER\\n\\t \\n\\tThere are four gospel accounts of the resurrection of Jesus in the New Testament: Matthew’s, Mark’s, Luke’s and John’s.  But none of them actually describe just what happened when Jesus’ body reportedly disappeared. So, right away, here is the tough part about Easter:  we just aren’t going to get a verifiable description or “proof” that any of this happened, not in the way our predominant culture demands certainty by amassing evidence.  Some of us have been told since childhood: forget a proof, just  “believe.”  Blindly accept this bizarre assertion and you will go to heaven.  Don’t believe it and you go to hell.  How on earth did so much of the Christian tradition get so far away from what Jesus intended?  It takes more than one Easter sermon to sort this out, but let’s see if we can get a sense of what’s going on in these empty tomb accounts.  I have found it’s less about assenting to something unproveable with our brain, and more like encountering, wondering about, engaging an unexpected perspective with our hearts.  When as we move deeper into this scene at Jesus’ tomb, what we actually get is testimony. What we encounter is the witness of those who experienced the Risen Jesus, and their descriptions of how this experience transformed their lives.  \\n\\tThe Gospel of John tells us that Mary Magdalene discovers the empty tomb first.  It’s quite remarkable this detail was retained in scripture, given how patriarchal and repressive of women the Christian church will later become.  Other men and women followers of Jesus were reported to have gone to Jesus’ grave that early morning.  But for some reason, Mary Magdalene is the only person mentioned in each of the four different Gospel versions of this empty tomb story.  Why this one piece of consistency in four divergent accounts?  Why was she so important to be repeatedly named?  Remember Dan Brown’s popular mystery-detective story, The Da Vinci Code?  Was it true, as Brown suggests, that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and had a child together?   This idea is offensive, even scandalous to some people, and it’s a rather titillating idea to others.  I wonder if the answer for her prominence doesn’t lie somewhere even more challenging.  Could it be, as an increasing number of Biblical scholars are suggesting, that Mary Magdalene was the follower, the disciple of Jesus, who actually got what he was teaching?  Was she the one who didn’t abandon hm, when the other disciples did, because she fully understood Jesus’ call to human transformation through self-emptying and sacrificial love?    \\n\\tWe follow this grieving and unnerved woman as she stumbles through the early darkness, looking for the body of her beloved Teacher and friend.   The Gospel of John has already described in previous verses that her visit is not about bringing spices and completing the burial preparations.  Nichodemus, the Jewish religious leader sympathetic to Jesus’ cause, had already supplied pounds of myrrh and aloes the night Jesus was buried.  The other followers are apparently in hiding, because surely the Roman soldiers are looking for them too.  So what is Mary Magdalene up to in the dark?  As she approaches, she is stunned to see the closure to the tomb rolled away.  Grave robbers? Proceeding no further, she runs to get several of the other men disciples.  Two of them come back with her, and peer into the cave-like enclosure.  They spot the pile of burial clothes.  Mary is still worried someone has stolen Jesus’ body.  But these bundled pieces of cloth would probably still be on Jesus’ body if someone had moved him to another location.  The men disciples recognize that the body is truly gone, but can’t make heads or tails of this.  They return to their homes.\\tBut Mary stays rooted to the spot, weeping.  She had hope for the cold comfort of seeing and touching Jesus’ dead body; but this has been taken from her.  Through her tears, she peers into the tomb again and sees two angelic beings standing where Jesus’ body should have been.  They seem to know something and begin to question her.  She suddenly senses another presence behind her.  Turning, she sees someone standing there, who repeats the angels’ question: “why are you crying?”  Not recognizing who this man is, she pleads, “Sir, tell me where his body is.” Then suddenly this someone calls her by name: Mary.  In that moment, she recognizes Jesus.  And the unrecognizable all of a sudden becomes incomprehensible: “Teacher, it’s you!”  In astonishment and joy, she naturally reaches for him.  But Jesus sees how her love for him is grasping, still yearning for a tangible corpse.  What she is now confronted with is an intangible aliveness beyond her wildest dreams (Cynthia Bourgeault, p. 130, Wisdom Jesus).  “Don’t hold on to me, don’t cling to me,” he tells her.\\n\\tThe Gospel writers want us to know that Jesus, despite all evidence of his dying, is now alive.  What? This challenging of the power of death itself is the most paradoxical part of the Easter claim for me.   Something dead is now alive.  Not a resuscitated body; this man who embodied God’s radically inclusive, unstoppable love was really dead…but has now been transformed into a living entity that is among us.  All this is less about belief and more about encounter.  And for several millennium, Christians have been saying much the same thing: we testify to this ongoing presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst, and how that presence is making new life, transformation, possible in us. \\n\\tThere is something almost ridiculous about this claim, in part because our best thinking can’t quite comprehend it.  How can it be that dead hopes and dreams, feeling dead inside, declining bodies, is not the final part of each of our stories? It is almost the stuff of dreams, not unlike the one the Spanish poet, Antonio Machado records in his poem “Last Night As I Lay Sleeping.”  The idea of new life busting out of deadness is so fantastical and error-like, it has to come to him under the cover of sleep, when his conscious, linear-thinking brain is no longer in charge.  Hear his words or follow on the front of the worship bulletin:\\t\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a spring was breaking\\nout in my heart.\\nI said: Along which secret aqueduct,\\nOh water, are you coming to me,\\nwater of a new life\\nthat I have never drunk?\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat I had a beehive\\nhere inside my heart.\\nAnd the golden bees\\nwere making white combs\\nand sweet honey\\nfrom my old failures.\\n\\nLast night as I was sleeping,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat a fiery sun was giving\\nlight inside my heart.\\nIt was fiery because I felt\\nwarmth as from a hearth,\\nand sun because it gave light\\nand brought tears to my eyes.\\n\\nLast night as I slept,\\nI dreamt—marvelous error!—\\nthat it was God I had\\nhere inside my heart.\\xa0 \\t\\n\\tMy mistakes, my failures, my deadness being transformed?  This can’t be right.  “Marvelous error,” Machado testifies, over and over.   How can it be that these changes come to me, he wonders.  I dreamt I had a fiery sun giving light inside my heart.  That’s crazy!  “Last night, as I slept I dreamt, marvelous error, that it was God I had here in my heart.”  The spirit of the living God, inside of our hearts.  “Fear not,” said Jesus at his last meal with his followers, “I will be with you always.”\\n\\tSometimes we get so caught up in the calculated logic of the world and what our conscious ego analyzes might be possible.  “I just can’t let go of that resentment, that disappointment, that mistake.”  We miss the possibility of our own inner healing of memories and our own changing of attitudes and habits. \\n\\tI wonder if in that moment of hearing Jesus call her name, Mary Magdalene finally recognizes her transformed self.   She is not just a woman frantically bereaved, torn from the person who embodied Gods’ radically inclusive love.  She is Mary, beloved disciple and forgiven one, a woman who has come to see her own old failures transformed.  One who came to know and accept her own precious self through her relationship with this Teacher and friend.  The crucified Jesus is now present in a new and different way; and his followers are to share his message and minister in his name.  Mary Magdalene gets it.  She will bring the good news of resurrection back to the disciples; her testimony will be the spark.  She will be called by the early, pre-patriarchal church, “the Apostle to the Apostles.” \\n\\tOn this morning, we encounter Jesus again, as he stood before Mary Magdalene on that garden path.  He  addresses us each of us by name, recalling us to our own precious selves.  May our testimonies spark new life and hope.\\n\\tFor Christ has risen.  Christ is risen indeed.

Anne Swallow Gillis \\n\\nRE-IMAGINING CHURCH MEMBERSHIP\\n \\n\\tIn our “what is the church?” ponderings last week, we considered a number of different Biblical metaphors for church.  A group of us joined in discussion following worship, and we talked about which of these metaphors resonated most closely with our sense of “church.”  Body of Christ, temple of the living God, family of God, citizens of God’s reign, light on the hill.  Someone noted that the Body of Christ imagery, with it’s recognition of the importance of each part of the Body, was especially important for those who have trouble speaking up in larger groups.  The Body must honor the quiet ones so everyone may participate in sharing their understanding of how the Spirit moves among us.  One of you noted that the image of us being “a light on the hill” was especially compelling, as it challenged the church to be a living example of justice, mercy and peace-making to the wider community.  This metaphor originates in the writings of the Hebrew prophets, who repeatedly called the nation Israel to be a “light,” a prophetic witness to God’s compassion for the marginalized. In the words of the Hebrew Bible scholar and United Church of Christ minister, Walter Bruggemann, the prophets “reframed what was at stake in chaotic times.”  They challenged the people of Israel to engage in “a ministry of imagination” where they would imagine together an alternative world, one where community would stand “in solidarity with victims of the present order.”  (Prophetic Imagination, Revised Edition)\\n\\n\\tToday we are re-imaging what church membership might mean and look like for us in this congregation. Perhaps when we commit to being a member of a local church, we are saying we join with a specific part of the Body of Christ to be part of this reframing of what is at stake in these chaotic times.  We commit to lifting up Biblical values about life together as humans, values that are often contrary to those of the materialism, rugged individualism, marginalization of the weak, domination of the powerful that prevail in our dominant culture.  As members, we join in this prophetic ministry.  As Professor Bruggeman puts it:  “The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us.”\\xa0 (Ibid) This indeed is a tall order.\\n\\n\\tThroughout this disturbing and dispiriting week of national news regarding the US Supreme Court Nomination, I have found myself grieving that we seem unable as a nation to be that beacon of light in the world.  We somehow have become divided into two Americas that, in the recent words of one columnist (Susan B. Glasser), “are growing more enraged by the minute and are not listening to each other.”  Several of you noted in our after-worship discussion last week how important it was for us, as church, to learn how to listen better to one another.  To listen with an open heart, not necessarily in agreement but with the intention to understand what the other person is saying. Listening not with a half ear that is silently preparing a refutation or retort to what has been said.  Perhaps joining a church means, “I’m willing to learn to really listen and share my views respectfully. And in the middle of careful listening, I will lovingly but firmly call out inappropriate behavior when I encounter it.”  Paul describes that for those who are spiritual discern all things, and they are themselves subject to no one else’s scrutiny.  Which I take to mean we don’t scrutinize, criticize or demean one another’s thoughts or stated beliefs.  But we do hold one another accountable for our behavior. Might this become a part of a membership covenant for us?  \\n\\n\\tIn this context, I think church membership is less about agreeing with certain beliefs about God or Jesus or the Holy Spirit.  It is more about the original meaning of the Greek work belief, credo, which is closer to the verb “to trust.”  Not “do you believe in God as some particular thing, but do you trust in that relationship, in that connection with God?”  Because the work of modeling loving behavior is difficult.   I need to lean into and trust that a power greater than me and my own good brain is informing me, guiding me, transforming me in this work.  I need to trust that my fellow members trust in the power of the living God in their own lives.  As we have witnessed in the recent confirmation hearings, righteous anger, self-protection, shouting and name-calling gets us nowhere except sickened and further divided.  Staying in tough conversations pushes us to trust in discerning a direction broader than our own best thinking.   \\n\\n\\tIn his letters, the Apostle Paul was exploring what it meant to follow the Jesus Way, as it was called in the early first century.  Which was very different from the way of the world, the prevailing Imperial Roman way.  Walter Bruggeman puts it like this:  “In both his teaching and his very presence, Jesus of Nazareth presented the ultimate criticism of the royal consciousness. He has, in fact, dismantled the dominant culture and nullified its claims. The way of his ultimate criticism is his decisive solidarity with marginal people and the accompanying vulnerability required by that solidarity.”\\xa0(Ibid)\\n\\n\\tIf we covenant with a congregation that values justice, peace and compassion, I believe we are saying:  I intend to be in solidarity with those who are marginalized and suffering.  I intend to make myself open to them. Which is not easy, because we have to learn to live with the sense of helplessness and grief that their vulnerability and suffering inevitably brings us.  We join a local church because we know we shouldn’t be doing this work alone.   We sense that something in us has to expand, re-arrange, perhaps even heal within each of our minds to do this work.  We have to grow new capacities for empathy, or as Paul puts it, we have “to be transformed by a renewal of our minds.”  We need to be with other people willing to submit themselves not just to doing good works, but doing the hard inner work of soaking themselves in scripture and immersing themselves in prayer and meditation so this transformation can happen.  Otherwise, our good works can become about our own ego and the need to be seen as helpful.  \\n\\n\\tChurch as a club or cozy community where we get our personal desires addressed and our needs met just is not going to cut it for the 21st century.  I wonder if what we need in our assembly as followers of Jesus are ways to renew our minds so we begin to see the world as Jesus say it. A place where our empathy muscles get nurtured, lovingly challenged and stretched. Not just because we have friends here but also because we encounter people different from us, with different worldviews and life perspectives. \\n\\n\\tI listened to an interview on MPR yesterday with Dr. Michael Thompson, a noted child psychologist who has specialized in researching how boys can be raised to be responsible and caring men.  In the wake of the public testimonies this week, some of us are reflecting on our own adolescent years.  And we are wondering about how, as adults, we might nurture boys to better negotiate the natural risk-taking, sexual exploration and relationship challenges of their teen years.   “It’s about helping teenage boys acquiring empathy,” says Dr.Thompson.  But how does one do that, asked the interviewer.  “We have to actually require empathy,” he replied, “just as a toddler does not naturally share his or her toys, we have to require that they do so when playing with others.”  There need to be consequences for non-empathic behavior!  He went on to describe how the best way to teach empathy to boys is to require that all boys spend some time taking care of young children.  He cited studies done with older teenage boys who had been counselors at sleep-away camps.  Their jobs were to help younger boys through times of homesickness, physical challenges, and learning to be part of a group working together.  The counselors’ empathy rates were much higher than other teens their age that had not spent time taking care of children.  Last Sunday, those working in our Christian Education program put out a call to each of us to help out with the Sunday School program with our children here.  Might one of the commitments as members of a church be the willingness to further develop our own empathy as adults as we take turns working with our children?  Might we be a place where the older boys in our community learn empathy by assisting with these programs?  How do you and I as members of a church actively envision a future where teenage boys learn about other people’s feelings, about consent, about respecting women and girls?  \\n\\n\\t“The task of prophetic ministry is to nurture, nourish, and evoke a consciousness and perception alternative to the consciousness and perception of the dominant culture around us.”\\xa0 As church members we get to say yes to such prophetic ministry.  We say yes to living into this ministry together.  Let’s keep exploring what this might mean for us as a congregation.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nBEING THE LIGHT\\n\\t\\n\\tA few thoughts about light this morning.  It’s presence, it’s absence, it’s imagined future.  Throughout Biblical history, times of distress and oppression have been described as “times of darkness.”  The Jewish prophets used this image of bleakness, absence of light, shadowy darkness to speak of the foreign occupation, the shock of captivity in Babylon in the 6th century.  The prophets reminded the people that God promises: there will come a day when the world will be shaped by the light of righteousness and peace.  The people of Israel were to be a beacon of justice and mercy that was so compelling that other nations would be drawn to God’s presence and power.  Centuries later, coming up out of this rich tradition, the Gospel writer Matthew sees these promises fulfilled as Jesus who bursts on local the scene.  Quoting the prophet Isaiah, Matthew reminds his own late first century community that all across the region, Jews and non-Jews alike who have “sat in darkness have (now) seen a great light.”  How might this image of being a “light in the darkness” propel our ministry as a church?  \\n\\tAncient Jewish poetry about light comes down to us in the Book of Genesis, oral stories finally recorded in writing long before the prophets or Jesus’ time.  “In the beginning, when God created the heavens and the earth, the earth was a formless void and darkness covered the face of the deep, while a wind from God swept over the face of the waters.”  The language is similar to Creation stories from various traditions around the world.  It begins with images of a great darkness, an embryonic shadow place devoid of light.  “Then God said, let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.”  Over the centuries, new visionaries have described emerging pictures of Creation, ones “swimming in stories about fireballs and photons and light.”  Since the early 1980’s, I have been drawn to the writings of Matthew Fox, Catholic priest and author who was eventually silenced by the Vatican for his revolutionary views of the nature and purpose of Creation.  He claimed that the Biblical creation stories are about an “original blessing” and not, as some early Christian church fathers had decided, about “original curse of original sin.”  But it was his conversations with physicists that first fascinated me.  From his dialogue with these scientists, he described his vision of creation in his book One River, Many Wells: Wisdom Springing from Global Faiths:  \\n\\tFifteen billion years ago, in a great flash, the universe flared forth into being.  In each drop of existence a primordial energy blazed with an intensity never to be equaled again…In the beginning the universe is a great shining that expands rapidly and then explodes into hundreds of billions of swirling dark clouds…\\nLater, a hundred billion galaxies light up with a splendor new to the universe.  The beginning of the universe is a smooth, intense flame.  A few billion years later the large-scale structure of the universe glows in great sheets of galaxies and in their intersections in long, spidery filaments of sparkling worlds.  \\n\\t “I am the light of the world….and you are the light of the world,” Jesus will go on to teach.   Scientists now tell us that all matter is actually slow-moving light; we exist at all because of the light.    Matthew Fox describes how “light drives all energy systems.  Plants eat light, you and I eat light, breathe light, drink light and transform light into energy.”  During the middle ages, Jewish mystics writing in the Kabbalah, described that human beings were created when sparks gathered together: “some sparks of light adhering (together) and some remaining hidden throughout the world, sparks of holiness (suffusing) and intermingling with everything in the world.”  Is it any wonder that Albert Einstein admitted in the early part of the last century that “all I want to do is study light.”\\n\\tAs I consider the light metaphors for the divine and for illumined understanding throughout the world religions, I am struck by this paradox of our lives as followers of Jesus.  If, as matter, you and I are already light, Jesus was actually calling us to be who we are!  Be the light!  But, in choosing to follow the Jesus way, among all the religious choices in the world, we are somehow called to two things: “to both share the light that we can see and feel; and we are also to share the light that we can only imagine.”  Maybe that is part of our job as a church in the 21st century.  Could we be called to share a light, shine out a perspective, a way of being together, that we cannot yet even imagine?  \\n\\tThe more I think about where we are as a congregation in this transition time, in this time between decline and renewal, I realized that it’s doing this prayerful imagining together that is the starting point for the change we seek.  The starting point is not new programs, it’s not being an open and affirming congregation or a Just Peace church, it’s not refurbished rooms, it’s not about new study groups or even new outreach projects, it’s not some surprise donor giving a huge gift, it’s not even hiring a wonderful new pastor.  All these, of course, matter….but they are not where you start if you want to renew the ministries of a congregation.  The starting point is within you.  It’s within each of us, as we seek to be more truly who we are, the light to the world.   The starting point for the renewal of the ministries of this church is in each of us as we seek to follow the Word of God as outlined in the scriptures, and as we seek to follow the Living Word of God in the person of Jesus.   As we pledge to support a future church reality that we can not yet fully imagine.  At the start, it’s not about church growth, or returning to the church you once were. It’s about the deepening of your relationship with the Light that is Jesus.  Experiencing the light of God’s transformative love and sharing it with others. \\n\\tIn everything we do in the life of our congregation, we have to ask ourselves this question:  will others see the light of God’s love and compassion in us?  In this way, will they see Jesus?  Will people see the light of Jesus in the way we shine a light on places of darkness and suffering in this community and world around us?  The medieval Jewish mystics spoke of “raising the sparks of the potent energy of the divine.”  What will get “sparked” around here, in the months and years ahead?\\n\\tJesus invites us to follow him into the unknown places of our lives, illumined by the light of his teachings and continued presence.  He promises that we will be changed, “sparked;” we will be transformed and better able to draw others to experience his power and love. “You are the light of the world,” says Jesus.   Be the light.  Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke 18:9-14\\n\\n\\nBEING REFORMED\\n\\nIn the pre-Christian northern Europe, late fall celebrations would focus on harvest, but also on dying: The dying season of autumn, the lurking presence of evil, and the thin veil between life and death itself.  In Christianized regions by the early 16th century, the old Celtic tradition of Samhain (saw-wain) had become All Hallows Eve, the special “hallowed” or holy day before all Saint’s Day.  We come to the year 1517, and a young German priest and university professor, Martin Luther, had become increasingly concerned about corrupt religious practices in the Church.  He knew that the Cathedral at Wittenberg would be packed with worshippers on All Saints, honoring those who had died for their faith. So the night before, on All Hallow’s Eve, Luther posted his 95 theses, his challenges to the Church, on the huge Cathedral door.   The statements condemned the Church’s selling of indulgences.  Local clergy, and the church hierarchy, all made money of off this system, which funded huge pubic building projects in far-away Rome.  You could buy a certificate which would eliminate your need for repentance of a particular sin you had committed, or a loved one’s soul could be sprung from purgatory.  Luther even claimed that the Bible, not just church tradition or the Pope’s rulings, was to be our sole guide in the Christian faith, and that it must be available in people’s own languages.  Lay people must be empowered to discern the movement of the Spirit, of the God who is still speaking, through the written scriptures and their own spiritual experiences.  \\nLuther’s provocative document was like a bomb, and would soon lead to a painful split in the Christian church.  Years of conflict followed, with hatred and spilled blood as Protestants also challenged repressive political structures and  envisioned the church of the future.  As the United Church of Christ, Protestants in the reformed tradition, we come from a long line of people who have looked into the future to see new things and spoken out honestly about what they saw.\\nThis story from Luke is the quintessential teaching of Jesus on prideful boasting and humility.  Perhaps the preacher should say: “Just Be Humble.  Amen!” and sit down.  But humility is problematic.  Was Luther being humble by claiming to see things differently than the Church of his day?  If we claim to be  humility, we aren’t really being humble anymore.  \\nWe are not sure just who was the target for this teaching parable that seems to be about humility.  The Gospel writer Luke records that “Jesus told this parable to some who trusted in themselves,” but no one is named.  But isn’t it a good thing to be able to trust yourself?  To be able to have confidence in how we will act in public, and not fall prey to whim or sudden urgings?  “To some who trusted in themselves that they were righteous,” says the text.  But, what is the problem with this?  It doesn’t say self-righteous.  To be “righteous” for a first century Jew (Jesus’ primary audience) was a good thing: it meant that you were acting with integrity in your relationship with God and with others, doing justice and walking humbly before your God.  So, what is the problem with these “some” Jesus is talking to?  Here it comes:  “they were righteous and regarded others with contempt.\\nAnd….. who among us hasn’t quietly held someone in contempt this week?  I sometimes catch myself moving into silent distain as I see or hear of someone else acting pompous or lazy or irrational or wasteful or too evangelical.  Dear God, thank you that I am not like…..fill in the blank.  This can be an especially tempting thing to do on Reformation Sunday:  Dear God, thank you that I am part of a Protestant tradition that celebrates individual freedom and autonomy, diversity of belief…….not like those other churches!  There is even a lack of humility and a sense of distain on the tongue-in-check bulletin cover for today!  Is it really our job to try and “fix” someone else’s theology?  Hmmmmm.\\n       “They were righteous and regarded others with contempt,” notes Jesus.  And he has his listeners’ attention now.  He proceeds to tell a tale of a respected religious leader, a Pharisee.  In the story, the Pharisee simply offers thanks to God that he is not like certain other people.  Unlike us, Jesus’ 1st century listeners would be rooting for the Pharisee at this point.  Pharisees were highly respected as thoughtful religious reformers of their time.  Their goal was to relate the Law more liberally and more closely to everyday spirituality and people’s circumstances.  It was only later in the first century, when the relationships between the Jewish synagogues and new Christian communities were getting tense over different interpretation of the Law and the meaning of Jesus, that “Pharisee” starts being seen in a negative way. \\nThe Pharisee is doing all the right and righteous things, and is sharing these with God in a private prayer “standing by himself.”  “I fast, I give a large portion of my income to the needy.”   “Wow, what an admirable person,” Jesus’ audience is probably saying to themselves.  Jesus then introduces the tax collector, and everyone assumes this will be the villain in the story.  In that time, tax collectors were despised collaborators with the occupying Roman rulers.  “God, be merciful to me, a sinner!” the tax collector cries.  And surprise, surprise, it is this man, speaking in dejected humility, who Jesus says is truly justified and accepted by God.   \\nAgain, Jesus surprises his listeners out of their everyday way of valuing behavior and worth.   If I’m not careful, I tend to lean into my own capacities, my productiveness, well….my upstandingness.  Perhaps we measure ourselves against others’ accomplishments.  We can become wary and even contemptuous of those unable to fend for themselves in our current economy.  Reassured by our capabilities, we might insist we don’t have much need for God’s help.  “It’s okay God, I’ve got it covered,” we may find ourselves praying; ever more trusting in our own self-sufficiency.   Not unlike the Pharisee, we get it about what kind of righteous life to lead….and we all become forgetful about the source of that righteous life.  The Pharisee prays to God, but has lost sight of his dependence on God, his source and sustainer.\\nYou may have noticed that the tax collector never actually repents in the story.  He doesn’t confess he has been excessive in his taxation of the locals, so he can profit.  But he starts in a place that most of us would like to avoid:  he acknowledges his total dependence on God.  And I think this idea makes most of us capable folks squirm.\\nMartin Luther’s challenge to the corrupt religious practices of the 16th century was this:  to assume God’s love for us does not rest on the merits of our behavior, or our abilities or our beliefs.  It’s all grace; it’s all God’s initiative, said Luther. We are held in this grace, we soak in it daily, and it’s our loss when we ignore it.  The tax collector gets it: he simply presents himself humbly to God’s merciful presence, which is there always.  Like most of Jesus’ stories, it’s about God’s persistent insistence that we are loveable and reformable all at the same time.  We can change, a congregation can be re-formed.  We can be transformed so we can better serve God’s healing purposes here on this broken and needy planet.\\nJesus “told this parable to some who trusted in themselves.”   So, perhaps we are each left with this question:  what do I trust beyond myself and my own capacities?  And any kind of trusting implies that I must humbly admit that I am not the center of my own small universe.  What do we trust beyond ourselves, our own perceptions, our own ego’s hunger to be right, to be secure, to be esteemed?   Questions to ponder in the week ahead.  Amen.\\n \\n\\n',\n",
       " 'February 16, 2020\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEpiphany 6A\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tDeuteronomy 30:15-20\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tMatthew 5:21-37\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t(from EUCC sermon)\\n\\n\\nCHOOSING LIFE\\n\\n\\tThis text from Deuteronomy, seems pretty straightforward: it’s better to chose life over death.  When we hear it starkly like that, there seems to be little more to say:  Of course…chose life over death!  That’s obvious, I can be down with that….wow, a 15 second sermon! Time for Coffee Hour!   But if “chose life over death” is so obvious, why is it so difficult to do?  Because it is so challenging, this may be why Moses spoke these words as his “last-will-and-testament” before he died.  Moses had led the Hebrew people out of slavery in Egypt, and helped them form into a community of justice and mercy under God’s guidance as they wandered for 40 years in the Exodus wilderness.  Now, finally looking out over the promised land of Canaan, the dying Moses gives the fledgling Jewish community these this final message:  Here is the deal, folks.  I won’t be going with you on this next part of your journey.  “I set before you life and prosperity, death and adversity.”    Walk in God’s ways, follow God’s commandments and don’t chase after idols.  You choose, life or death, blessings of land and plenty and loving God, or curses of no land and perishing.   But is life ever this black and white?  This is starting to sound pretty autocratic and harsh.   We might be inclined to simply dismiss this reading; it’s the Old Testament, right, that’s all about God’s law and judgment and the New Testament is all about God’s love!    \\n\\n\\tOn to the New Testament reading from the Gospel of Matthew, for something a little more….. palatable? Cheery?  More loving?  And here is Jesus, appearing to double-down on teachings “of ancient times” and making everything way harsher.  These are not casual behavior suggestions. These words of Jesus are clearly directive: they exhort; they tell us in no uncertain term what to do and what not to do.  More hackle-raising scripture texts, we may mutter to ourselves.  We could have everyone stand up and go to one of four corners in the Sanctuary, depending on what offends us most in this Matthew passage:  Everyone bugged by Jesus’ view on resentment and anger being worse than murder, go to the far corner on that side?  Don’t like Jesus saying that lust and leering are worse than adultery?  Repulsed by the injunctions to cut off offending parts of our bodies?  Go to the far corner on the other side.  Offended to hear that remarrying is connected to adultery?  Hang out up here with me, because as someone went through a divorce in her mid-30’s, I’m really annoyed about that one.  And this final whopper, don’t swear by anything!  Gather up here on the other side of the chancel if you think swearing by God, the Bible or your mother’s grave is better than lying.   Which one of these four commandments bug you the most?  And you thought the ancient Torah teachings of the Law were tough? says Jesus.  Check out what I’m going to ask you to do if you want to follow me, if you want to actually live compassionately and harmoniously in community.  Choosing life over death has now become more complicated.\\n\\tThe problem with being told to do or not do something is that we often bristle, feel resistant, perhaps even a bit defensive.  Anyone having ever been around a toddler knows that this starts at about age 2.  At that age, we are beginning to develop a sense of our self as separate from our parents/caregivers, and this involves some inevitable challenging of authority.  “No!” the 2 year old delights is saying, with ferocious enthusiasm!  As we become older and start to separate from our parents, we grow as a separate individual who is still connected to a family unit.  And we often define ourselves by who our family is not.  In 8th grade I declared I was an atheist, in part because my parents were not.  As a senior in high school I became strongly evangelical in my Christian faith, in part because my progressive church-going parents were most assuredly not evangelical Christians.  Both of these religious stands had to do in part with my striving to do (what psychologists have come to call) the necessary “separation and individuation” to become an autonomous adult.      \\nAs adolescents and young adults, many of us talk of wanting to be “free” but we are not yet sure just what this might mean.   This happens often in more progressive church.  But “free” for what?  As an adult, I have come to realize that simply being oppositional to authority, without figuring out for myself what I value and believe, was a dead end. I might be against this or that, but what was I ultimately for?   \\n\\tI think this passage from Matthew gives us guidance on that really “ups the ante” when it comes to living in community….To figuring out what we are free for…. Paradoxically, these ways of living may lead to what can make us the most free: choosing life over death on a daily basis, in our every-day choices. \\nBut we have to be careful not to pull Jesus’ words out of their historical and cultural context.  Take care not to get diverted by today’s translation that has Jesus saying you’ll “be liable to the hell of fire.”  The actual word is not hell, but Gehanna.  In Jewish tradition, this word referenced an actual valley where long ago people used to sacrifice children to the Canaanite god Moloch.  Like saying to naughty children, “you hit your brother again and we will send you to Gehanna”…or fill in the blank for whatever scarey institution like a prison or mental hospital was down the road.  \\t \\nJesus had an uncanny way of understanding the perceptions, attitudes and emotions that often come before an act that is contrary to God’s Law.  Before there is murder, adultery, divorce or swearing falsely, there is a subtle but significant shift in how we are thinking and feeling.  And that shift is what Jesus was concerned about, because these shifts can move us towards deadening spiral in our lives.  We loose vitality and we begin to hurt ourselves and other people.   We start to choose death, not life.\\n\\t(Dr. Amy Oden, professor of Church History at Wesley Theological Seminary in Washington, DC, WorkingPreacher.org commentary, Epiphany 6A).   In Jesus’ time, simply following the rules meant that in both the patriarchal Jewish and Roman society any married woman could be divorced and discarded quite easily.  It took us until the 20th century to pass laws in this country that protect women from automatically loosing their property, children and livelihood when a marriages ends.  First century women lost everything; they were left destitude. This isn’t right, said Jesus.  Participation in the Kingdom of God entails a different kind of righteousness.  It’s about a mutual compassion and support that brings mercy and justice to human intention and behavior.  \\n\\tIn considering Jesus’ command about murder, Professor Oden admits that when we are in disagreement with someone else in our church community, few of us actually consider killing that person.  But how many times have we been angry over some perceived slight or some unresolved misunderstanding in the church? In an effort to be polite or keep the peace, we choose a small death: we either keep it inside or we go “sideways” and tell someone else about how bothered we are, venting, hoping that word will be “passed along”  It amazes me that while Jesus never founded a church like we know it today, he was spot-on about one of the most common problems in congregations:  unresolved conflict which simmers and seeps and moves side-ways, and sucks the life and trust out of a congregation. Thriving churches learn that everyone should be heard, but everyone doesn’t always get their way.  Churches increasing in vitality such as ours are exploring how to handle inevitable disagreements with honesty and compassion.  Thanks be to God.\\n\\tOne thing I find so compelling about Jesus is his ability to see inside people.  In following the Spirit of the Risen Jesus Christ, I am helped to see inside myself.  I’m become more aware as I am faced with choices between life-giving attitudes and actions, and between death-giving attitudes and actions.  \\nThis indwelling Spirit helps me honestly face the stuff on the inside, my internal orientation that initiates my actions.  “This is where the choosing life or death really lies,” implies Jesus.   It’s way before the murderous action; it is in the resentment and grudges we harbor.  It is way before the adulterous affair; it is in the way we pay more attention to work, sports or the Internet instead of our life partner (Amy Oden, IBID).   The choice is way before the actual divorce; it is in the slow breakdown of communication and mutual respect.  It’s way before the swearing falsely, it is in our equivocating.  It is when we refuse to let our “yes” be “yes” and our “no” be “no.”   Choosing life or death.\\nMay we be challenged to our bones by these words from both Moses and Jesus.   For these teachings are freedom-filled and life-giving.  They help us choose life.  Amen. \\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nMANY STORIES, ONE JESUS:\\nTHE WITNESS OF MARK\\n\\n\\tHello, my name is Mark and I hail from Jerusalem, present day Israel where it is warm and dry!  This is quite amazing, here I am in the 21st century on the snowy north shore of Lake Superior.   You see, I lived during the 1st century, in the days of the early Jesus movement.  Back then, none of us thought much about the on-going-life-as-usual.  We were all so blown away that Jesus’ spirit was alive among us, and we shared everything that we had with each other and the fancy, rich folks even hung out with the low life and it was amazing….we thought about an End Times that was going to happen right away!  The Risen Jesus was coming back soon, and that the Kingdom of God and the overthrow of the Roman government was going to happen!  Whoa, I guess you can hear my urgency.  Maybe that’s why my Gospel is so short and written in the present tense, (unlike Luke and Matthew who sure do drag on and on!)  My community really thought God’s reign of justice and peace, as foretold by prophets like Isaiah, was right around the corner!  But wait, I’m getting ahead of myself a bit.   Let me properly introduce myself and tell you why I wrote my book about this amazing man Jesus.\\n\\tIt may be weird for you all to hear this, but back in my time we didn’t all share the same beliefs about Jesus. There was a lot of variety of opinion among us early Christians, and some tension between us, but somehow that didn’t stop our sense of unity in what we experienced as the spirit of the Risen Christ.  In fact, we sure were NOT in agreement about the birth of Jesus or even the importance of the birth stories!  Since I can see you are getting ready to celebrate his birthday on Christmas, let me just say that I didn’t really care much about where Jesus came from or who his parents or ancestors were.  The apostle Paul wrote earlier than me, and he apparently didn’t care either; he never mentions the birth stories in his letters. Neither does the Gospel writer John.  Matthew and Luke get into those birth stories BIG time, for their own reasons; but I’ll let them have their say the next few Sundays!   The big deal for me, and I put it right at the front of my gospel, is that Jesus was the “Son of God.”   To me that was the important part of his ancestry, that he came from God.  And…that his being the Son of God actually had some important implications for who WE are.   I’ll get to that part in a minute!\\n\\tAs an aside, I think you all have the right idea when you say you  “don’t take the Bible literally but take it seriously.”   I mean, look at me and Matthew and Luke and all the different things each of our Gospels say.  And John – holy cow, that guy is out on another planet with his wild symbolic language – Jesus as bread?  Jesus as the door?  Jesus as the light of the world?  Whoa!   \\n\\tOkay, back to me.  I started writing down some of the sayings about Jesus that came down through his disciple Peter, and other folks who knew him. Now please, understand this, I was NOT writing a biography of Jesus.  In fact, you are going to get really mixed up if you look at any of our four gospels as historical biography.  That doesn’t mean you won’t find history in them.  But they are written for another purpose; they are theological statements.   Each author giving his view of who Jesus was and what this means.   Like when Pastor Anne, if she is doing her job, reads the scriptures and pays attention to the current news and sees where it all connects in her sermons.  What was God doing in the past and what is the new thing God is doing in the world today?  We wrote our gospels so our different communities would understand how the Good News of Jesus connected with their specific time and place.   \\n Biblical scholars argue a lot about just who I was, and where and when I lived.  They DO agree I’m not the Mark who was one of Jesus disciples.  First of all I didn’t start writing down this stuff about Jesus until about 70 AD, so go figure.  Maybe I knew Jesus when I was a kid; some say I hung out with the apostle Peter and helped him with the Jerusalem Church.   It’s not really important, except for you to know that the destruction of the Jewish temple in Jerusalem was a really big deal for my community.  A lot of us had Jewish parents or Jewish-Christian parents, and it was like having your ancestral home destroyed.  How could God let this happen, we asked ourselves?  Some of my community even wondered if God had let the Temple be destroyed because some of our Jewish brothers and sisters did not believe Jesus was the promised Messiah.  And there was also a lot of ongoing tension with those Roman troops who were still all over the place, and Emperor Nero thought it was really entertaining to arrest and torture those of us who claimed to be Jesus disciples.  \\n\\t. We were going through some hard times.  We even had to listen to the Emperors refer to themselves as “son of God.”  Sickening.  We really struggled in my community with the whole deal about suffering, when good people have bad things happening to them.  I wanted to encourage my folks, so first I introduced Jesus with his baptism, when God speaks and says that Jesus was God’s beloved son.  I think Jesus’ sense of purpose, his need to teach and heal people, didn’t really sink in for him until that moment. And here’s the wild part about his being the “son” of God.  Maybe this sounds scandalous to you but I think he was trying to remind ALL of us that as humans, we each are sons and daughters, beloved children of the living God.  On top of that bold claim, calling Jesus the “Son of God” was also a radical and dangerous political statement, given that the emperors were fond of calling themselves divine as Sons of God.  Everytime we called Jesus “son of God” we were reminding ourselves that the true ruler of the world was NOT the Roman emperor and his minions. \\n\\tI wrote my book because I wanted to encourage my people, and remind them that even scary, dangerous “wilderness” times can be filled with hope.  That’s probably why I started my gospel with this passage about John the Baptist that you read today.  I wanted everyone to know that the Good News that Jesus brought followed the prophecies of Hebrew scriptures, that Jesus was actually continuing the past.  The wilderness is where the Jews followed God through the Exodus from slavery in Egypt, the wilderness was where John the Baptist was preaching and encouraging people to repent, to turn their lives around and commit to God’s ways….and the wilderness is where Jesus went right after he was baptized by John and the Holy Spirit came down.   \\n\\tThe challenging, wilderness times in our lives can creep up gradually, like a chronic illness or an unraveling marriage.  We are still God’s precious sons and daughters.  The wilderness times can blast upon us like a winter storm, an unexpected disappointment, an unanticipated failure, a sharp miscommunication, a sudden accident or death.  In wilderness times we are stripped down to the basics of who and what we trust.  And we are still God’s beloved children.   I wanted my people to know that God, through the power of the Living Christ, was with them in their wilderness times; that God was bringing them together in sharing, in fellowship and praise, encouraging them, urging them on.   Maybe when you read my gospel, you will sense this too.  Good to talk with you about my book!  Prepare a way for God in your hearts this Advent season.  Because God comes among you, even now!   Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'October 20, 2013\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tOrdinary Time 19C\\nEmmaus United Church of Christ\\t\\t\\tLuke 18:1-8\\nVienna, VA\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPsalm 121\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\n\\t\\n\\nDO WE PESTER OR PRAY?\\n\\n\\tThe context for this curious parable in Luke story is a conversation Jesus is having with his close followers.  Jesus has just given everyone an earful with some rather ominous sounding apocalyptic predictions about the end times.  His friends are understandably unnerved, and so he speaks of prayer and tells them this cautionary story about a needy widow and a unjust judge.  Like any parable, the language is condensed and the meaning/meanings may be many.  This story appears to be about Jesus’ followers’ need “to pray always and not to lose heart,” says Luke as he introduces the story.  This idea of “praying always” echoes what we hear in the Apostle Paul’s letters to his young churches.  Does this mean one is to constantly be muttering certain prayers through the day?  Or did Jesus mean a certain stance in the present moment, maintaining an on-going awareness of God’s unseen, animating presence and guiding direction?  And what about “do not lose heart?” Is this just about losing courage?  The heart, and not the rational brain, was considered the seat of wisdom in the ancient world.  This organ of deep knowing was the way we humans might perceive the mystery of the unseen, of God and God’s realm on earth.  Was Jesus saying: don’t lose your connection to this seat of wisdom within you? \\nTo illustrate his point, Jesus proceeds to tell another parable.  But on first reading, this story about a wronged widow and an uncaring and resistant judge seems to imply if we pester God enough, we will get what we want.  Does this actually work?  It hasn’t been my experience that if I bug God long enough God gives me what I ask for.  And the more I think about this I realize I don’t believe “getting what I want” is why Jesus taught us to pray in the first place.  Talking about prayer is tricky; there are a lot of different views on prayer.  I suggest we It move “side-ways” for a moment, to stretch our perceptions and imaginations a bit.  Consider this additional story from an unknown author; a parable of two frogs and a bowl of cream:  \\nTwo frogs fell into a deep cream bowl;\\nThe one was wise, and a cheery soul.\\nThe other one took a gloomy view\\nAnd slipped beneath the surface, hopeless and blue.\\nSaid the other frog with a merry grin,\\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"\\nAnd as he swam, though ever it seemed,\\nHis struggling began to churn the cream\\nUntil on top of pure butter he stopped,\\nAnd out of the bowl he quickly hopped.\\nThe moral, you ask? Oh, it\\'s easily found!\\nIf you can\\'t get out, keep swimming around.  \\n(Author Unknown) \\u2028\\xa0\\nWhen we fall into a mess, don’t we just wish it was sweet cream!   The point of this silly cautionary tale, however, may be that the frog’s continual swimming causes something new to happen, and saves his neck.  Through his ongoing persistent actions, something changes in the cream bowl, in the environment around him.  He doesn’t just loose heart, give up, and blub-blub let himself drown.   Most young children understand the flow of this kind of story:  The hard-working ant contrasted with the lazy grasshopper in Aesop’s fables; the “little engine that could”  - “I think I can, I think I can” - who finally makes it up the huge hill.   And here, in Luke’s gospel today, the story of the feisty widow who keeps at it, persistently demanding that this unjust judge hear her case.   Something about our persistence changes things.  But what does it change?\\n“How much more will your just and loving God answer your prayers?” Jesus demands of his listeners.  He has told a contrast story, with almost absurd charactures:  vulnerable, powerless widow with no legal rights in her society, claiming that she will sock this judge in the eye (literal reading of “wear me out”) if he doesn’t hear her case.  A grumpy and arbitrary judge, who by Jewish law is specifically required to defend the rights of orphans and widows.  But the judge admits doesn’t even follow the two basic tenets of Jewish law: love God and treat your neighbor as you would yourself!  \\nIf we aren’t careful, we might equate God with the judge in the story.  Does God “need to be irritated before relenting” ? (William Loader, Uniting Church of Australia website, Pentecost 21).   Are we to pray and pray and pray, to keep bugging God about our needs, like a child might pester a reluctant parent. Like Bart and Lisa Simpson repeatedly asking, “please Dad, please Dad, please Dad.”?  Is it our job to somehow rattle God out of a stinginess, an aloofness, to get God’s attention?  I don’t know about you, but I’m not interested in a God who has to be persuaded and cajoled into helping humanity.  This image just doesn’t fit with the Biblical narrative of an attentive Creator God who sees the sparrow fall out of the tree and counts the hairs on our heads.  \\nPersistence in the practice of prayer is something more than pestering God about how we feel the world should be.  Returning to the tale about the two frogs who fell in the cream; it is the frog who keeps swimming, who keeps moving and engaging with the stuff around him, who finds his world changing.   I have found that daily conversation with God slowly changes both me and my perception of the spaces and people around me.  Situations seem to shift before my eyes.  Things often begin to look different.  What was slippery, treacherous cream slowly becomes firm butter and a way out of my mess.  There is something about our back and forth exchanges with God, as we express our thanks, our frustrations, our sadness, our anger, our wonderings, that begins to transform the world around us and begins to even change us.  \\nPerhaps this is the inner transformation we hear in this pilgrimage song of Psalm 121.  On a journey to the holy Temple in Jerusalem, the travelers look up to the hills before them.  Rugged terrain, bandits could be hiding, it all looks threatening!  But up into the steep hills they climb, wondering together about where help will come from.  Climbing, singing together, they recall their history as a sojourning people, who have known God’s help, this Holy One who has made the earth, the cosmos, which surrounds them.  As they see the treacherous path before them, they face their own sense of helplessness.  They sing back and forth as they steadily move upward, into the threatening place of little water, sharp crags, deep gullies and high peaks.  Their song is prayer: they sing gratitude for this God who does not sleep, who is with them always, as shade in the hot sun and preserver from evil.  We might wonder how is it that “a place of threat” can also be where help comes from?”  Threatening mountains become a place from which help will come. (Working Preacher site, 10/20/19). We stare that challenging situation or person or memory right in the face, we take heart.  We keep moving in spite of our fear, we keep naming God’s steady presence in our midst, we engage with persistence and hope.  Praying always in this way, we start to change.  \\nI think our challenge in the 21st century church is to build a supportive, encouraging, Biblically based faith community which is persistent in both prayer and scripture reading. Reading, meditating upon, soaking in God’s word becomes part of a dialogue between us, our Biblical ancestors and the Holy Spirit moving in our midst.  This is the foundation that makes our outreach and mission work possible and effective.  And persistent prayer and scripture soaking can soften our hearts, help us become more loving and forgiving.  It can help us decide which of the overwhelming social action needs we should address together.   \\nHow might we, during this transitional period, begin to explore new ways to be together in prayer, be it in church meetings or fellowship groups?  How might we experiment with different opportunities to soak in the scriptures together?  I would love to hear your thoughts on this. \\nI have experienced that the ongoing action, the “swimming” in the practices of prayer and scripture reading, can transform us and better equip us for service in this world.  The frog in the cream was “wise and had a cheery soul,” in part because he kept swimming. \\n\"I can\\'t get out, but I won\\'t give in;\\nI\\'ll swim around till my strength is spent,\\nThen I will die the more content.\"  \\nAnd in the midst of our prayerful persistence, and through our acts of healing and kindness, the world around us is changed.  Butter starts to form where there once was cream, and all kinds of new possibilities emerge!  Thanks be to God!  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tLuke 23:33-43\\n\\n\\nGOD’S REIGN, OUR HOME\\nOver the years, I have received an annual, cheery Thanksgiving card from my auto insurance company.  One of those seemingly neutral holiday greeting, perhaps sent with the assumption that I will celebrate a traditional American Thanksgiving, whatever religion I may or may not profess.  A recent card featured a painting of a young white family pouring out of a van and into the welcoming arms of an elderly white couple.  A happy and poignant reunion scene under a tree ablaze in fall colors.  Inside the card were these words: “Coming Home: The sheltering arms of a golden maple, lasting stone walls, a family going home for the holidays – enduring images of a safe and secure time and place.” \\n\\tAs I gazed at this greeting card, I thought about how unpredictable, unsettled the world, and our nation, seems right now.  Many of us continue to follow the impeachment hearings and wonder what will happen next.  Is our nation’s leadership truly helping our nation, the wider world, to be a “safe and secure time and place?”  I think about communities where people don’t believe that their neighborhood, their schools, their houses of worship are a safe and secure places suggested on my insurance company’s greeting card.  In the midst of all this, I can feel this longing for home, places of certainty and safety inside of me, where my adult children and their beloveds join us for celebratory meals, and even relocate to northern Minnesota!\\nI sense there is this disconnect for many of us: between my insurance company’s homey Thanksgiving vision and the way our lives really are.  And in the middle of this disconnect, we come to worship and find that the church calendar does something quite unsettling.  We’re just about ready for Advent and Christmas, and now we are reading about Jesus being mocked as he hangs on the cross?  The timing seems weird.  We’re getting ready to move on to baby Jesus stories!  Many us are struggling to pull it together and move forward with some hopefulness after unsettling days in our church.  We’re doing our best to sing upbeat Thanksgiving hymns, plan a Community dinner and our own personal menus, anticipating the in-gatherings of loved ones.  But, as our cycle of scripture readings conclude at the end of November, every year at this time we are pulled back to the tense days of Jesus’ arrest and execution.  Certainly a jarring departure from visions of predictable safety and security, of families and friends gathering for feasting and fellowship!  \\nThe texts for today challenge us to consider what we really do believe about safety and security in the world, the Kingdom/Realm of God and the ultimate role of Jesus Christ in our lives today.  It was Pope Pius in 1925 who initially put out the call to identify the last Sunday in the liturgical year as  “Christ the King/Reign of Christ Sunday.”  As Protestants, we could certainly ignore this.  But Pope Pius made an oddly prescient decision with this declaration, during a period of both hopefulness and real bleakness in the 1920’s.   It was a time when nations watched the rise of new repressive dictators and fascism emerging in Europe over the shambles of World War I.  Perhaps not a bad idea to invite the church universal to consider some of the wider questions of “who is in charge,” in this chaotic world and how do we hold leaders accountable.  \\nI am not suggesting that triumphalism in phrases like “Christ the King” makes Christianity the only viable or true religion on earth.   I am noticing that\\ntoday’s texts ask us to take a hard look at the very powers that rule among us that are “destroying and scattering,” in Jeremiah’s words.  “Driving away” and hurting the very community that they are charged to support and protect.  The prophet Jeremiah voices God’s concern and dismay as the people of Israel struggle after returning from exile in Babylon 6th century BCE:  a series of Jewish kings had become corrupt. Having sold out to the interests of the wealthy and powerful, they no longer maintain the well-being of the people.  They had not been good shepherds of the people.  As one Biblical commentator (Richard Nysse), notes:  “Hurt caused by poor (human) leadership is a problem for God.”  The text “doesn’t assert specific leadership principles”  - it simply “announces the attention of God and the events that ensue from that attention.”  Or, I would put it a bit more bluntly:  it’s as though God finally says, “damn-it, all of you, Enough!  I’ll do it!  I’m going to gather the remnant, bring them back into the fold, help them be fruitful and multiply, and raise up one in the future who will reign wisely and will rule with justice and righteousness.”  \\n\\tAfter meeting Jesus and choosing to follow the Jesus Way, first century Christians looked back at this ancient text and said to themselves:  Here we are under oppressive Roman imperialist rule.  Yes, Jesus is the one that God was talking about in this prophetic passage, the righteous one to come.  Early Christians would look back to the crucifixion of Jesus and remember the taunting sign above his head, “King of the Jews.”  Jesus was mocked with this title “Messiah,” which was later translated into the Greek word “Christos,” or Christ. In years to come, filled with a sense that Christ’s spirit continued to live in them and guide them, Christians would compare Jesus’ “kingship” or authority to Roman imperial rule of their day.  And it produced a very counter-intuitive image:  because for the early Christians, their’s was a humbled and crucified king.  They followed the spirt of one who governs with compassion and justice, in humility, accompanying the vulenerable.  As the UCC theologian and minister Tony Robinson comments on this passage, whoever Jesus is for us, the New Testament claims that “This King is one who doesn’t rule, but stands with; doesn’t assert but surrenders; is not in the self-interest business.” “Note well,” concludes Robinson, “safety and security are not the result of more security measures or security police or security technology.”  I would suggest this is true of churches following times of intense conflict.  Safety and security does not necessarily come from getting mired in grievances, in re-hashing, in blaming, in tightening up and decreeing new rules that will somehow prevent future conflict between pastor and congregtion, between lay leaders and church members.  As Robinson continues, safety and security “are the result of a healthy community characterized by justice and righteousness.”   I would add, healthy community is characterized by direct and respectful communication, empathy, accountability, humility and forgiveness.\\nIt takes daily practice to absorb this reality that our safety and security are in God.  We won’t get it just from cheery greeting cards.  I’ve spoken before about the huge map of the world that has hung on various living room walls at our home over the years.   One of my prayer practices is to bodily lean against the map.  I think about the mystery of God’s reign of justice and righteousness, hope and mercy and how I might be a larger part of that tending and healing.  I imagine how our home of ultimate safety and security is in the mystery and power of God’s presence.  I am not talking about protection, but about accompaniment.  God-with-us.  Staring at the map, I look for a few hot spots on the planet:  places where enmity and fear and hatred continue to boil.. One could even do this with a map of Cook County, or the City of Grand Marais!   I place my two hands on two different places and lean my head into the map.  I let my prayerful attending imagine God’s restorative attention. \\nThese scripture texts stretch our  imaginations, just as we want to focus inward on hearth and physical home.  The texts remind me that forces of destruction and scattering are not the last word.  God is at work in the midst of all this, inviting our partnership.  The texts call us to notice and attend to those not feeling safe and secure, to accompany those who struggle in these days.  I give thanks for these provocative texts, and for this time to thank God and reflect together.  Amen.  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTHE URGENCY OF GOD’S REIGN\\n\\nWe have some challenging, gritty themes in today’s scripture lessons.  Perhaps this is fitting, given the tumultuous waters this church has navigated over many months and that we will assemble for our summer congregational meeting after worship today.  From contentious congregational meetings to contentious presidential debates to contentious editorials about gay people in our local newspaper, I sense an general urgency about “how are we to live together in community?”  Luke’s text, focusing on the costs of being on the “Jesus Way,” is blunt and almost callous about this question.  What is Jesus getting at here?  The Apostle Paul goes on a rant about bad behavior and then lifts up seemingly impossible behavior standards.  But how do we be and act together as humans?  To push us a bit further, what might these ancient texts have to say to us, here at the conclusion of PRIDE month, as an Open and Affirming Congregation?  Perhaps that’s a good place as any to start.\\nWe live in an era when the majority of millennials polled claim that the Christian church as a whole is homophobic.  Across the globe, LGBTQ people are harassed and shunned, and in some places are arrested and even executed. Our nation has finally legalized same gender marriage and the opening of our military, adoption rights, housing and employment opportunities to the LGBTQ community.  But in recent years, many of these advances are being challenged and eroding.  Violence against transgender people, particularly women of color, continues to sky-rocket.  Here in this church, we fly the rainbow flag and affirm the freedom of letting people be who they are as children of God.  You took a vote in ____and proclaimed that human dignity and respect applies to all people, regardless of sexual orientation or gender identity.  This is something of which we can be proud.  But now what?  How do we truly live out this pronouncement in new ways?  How might today’s scripture readings compel us to new action together?\\nHere in Paul’s letter to the young church at Galatia, he is urging his congregation to consider the nature of freedom they now experience as a community of the Risen Christ.  “Freedom,” interesting choice of words.  Often people compare Christian ethics to a pair of constricting undergarments.   For freedom Christ has set us free, writes Paul.  Stand firm, therefore, and do not submit again to a yoke of slavery.13\\xa0For you were called to freedom, brothers and sisters;[]\\xa0only do not use your freedom as an opportunity for self-indulgence,[]\\xa0but through love become slaves to one another.\\xa0He is not talking about being a prissy, well-behaved nice Christians.  He is inviting followers of Jesus to recognize they take on a new “yoke,” a new obligation of compassion and respect in community together.  More specifically, he warns them about the “works of the flesh,” about destructive behavior that can enslave us.  Don’t get caught up in the “flesh” word and think this is just about naughty things we might do with our bodies.  Paul speaks of behavior that comes out of our anxious survival mode, when we are most fearful or angry or sad.   Living out of this instinct for survival, self-protection, inhibits the “fruits of the Spirit” growing in us.  We “bite and devour each other” says Paul.  Ouch.  That hits close to home - ? We can lose track of how to be loving, joyful, patient, kind, generous, and gentle with one another.  We lose our self-control and become reactive.  We seem enslaved by our fear and anger and deep grief.  Pay attention to this inside work, Paul insists, especially if you start to feel anxious and self-protective!\\nThe Luke passage is equally demanding.  The writer describes Jesus  “with his face set towards Jerusalem.”  Luke uses this common Semitic phrase, “his face set,” which is meant to show one’s opposition or hostility.  The reader is reminded that Jesus has become accepting of the opposition to his radical teachings on the Kingdom of God.  Not some pie-in-the-sky reward of heaven. Jesus described God’s kingdom as breaking into the present reality, as compassion and justice and equality and freedom spreading through communities and systems of oppression.  He now sets his eyes on a collision course with those in religious and political power in the great city. \\nPerhaps we can picture the group of men and women traveling through the country-side with this Jesus who is sounding more and more agitated and insistent.  We might imagine a disquiet settling over these faithful companions who have ministered with him through Galilee.  Jesus probably seems more inwardly focused.  His words are cutting more sharply and opposition with the authorities increases.  The tension has been building among them; the disciples are probably feeling uncertain and even frightened.  People seldom act well when they are anxious and afraid. It’s not surprising what comes out of their mouths next.\\n“You won’t believe this Jesus, but those Samaritans who wanted us to talk to?  So rude! They wouldn’t even extend us the expected stranger hospitality!  They said you are going to the wrong sanctuary, the Temple Jerusalem!  They think Mt. Gerizim is the correct sanctuary for feast days and festivals, so they won’t help a pilgrim traveler headed for what they consider to be the wrong sanctuary!  We couldn’t believe our ears!  It’s outrageous!  What do you say we “command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?”   “What are you thinking?” Jesus replies.  We can imagine his jaw is set in annoyance, his eyes flashing with anger:  “What is it about ‘love your enemy’ that you do not understand?”  I can relate to these disciples’ reaction and desire to lash out.  I can imagine Jesus being frustrated with my own overreactions when I want to attack someone with firey vengence for this-that-or-the-other-offense.  “Well, it would be just easier if this person were somehow taken out of the picture,” I confess I have muttered to myself, and to God, more than once in my life.  \\nBut Jesus is already moving forward and we do well to pay attention.  He doesn’t punish the inhospitable Samaritans who reject his message, nor the disciples for their irrationally reactive suggestion.   It is clear that not only are they not to punish those who reject Jesus’ message; they are simply to let them go.  This is deeply challenging for most of us.  It has implications for our personal lives as well as our life together as a congregation.  There is both loss and learning in a time of major transition such as ours here.  We have the possibility of being carried into the future by God’s intentions among us, by God’s mission as we understand it.  Some will agree with our sense of mission and purpose and come with us, and some will go elsewhere.  Luke tells us Jesus kept moving forward:  and “then they went on to another village.”\\t\\nAs if this doesn’t give us pause…..What comes next in the reading is tough language about discipleship: somebody is gushing that they will follow Jesus wherever he goes and he replies: “The Son of Man has nowhere to lay his head.”   As one Biblical commentator has noted (Walter Brueggeman) “there will be no safe place and we can’t look back to previous loyalities.”  (Brueggman blog, Sojourners).  For a congregation in transition this might this be a warning about previous loyalities to previous pastors, or perhaps more painfully, loyalties to longtime members or previous lay leaders who have now disappeared.   One of the disciples seems eager to respond to Jesus but insists: “Jesus, first I have to bury my dead.”  Another pipes up, “I have to say farewell to my family.”  Affection for past leadership, honoring one’s dead, connecting with family; none of these are bad or evil in themselves.  Yet Jesus is pointing into the future.  \\nWhen the first PRIDE parade happened in New York City 50 years ago, it challenged us into the future as a nation and as Christian communities. The United Church of Christ  became one of the first Protestant denominations to embrace this challenge of affirming diversity and equality, with the ordination of the first openly gay minister, support of same-gender marriage and protection of transgender people.  As a denomination, we claim that Jesus envisioned a different kind of social, cultural and political order, where people are treated with dignity and equality, no matter who they love.  Where might this point us in the future?\\nNo one who puts a hand to the plow and looks back is fit for the kingdom of God, Jesus concludes in today’s reading.  Palestinian plows were both light and notoriously wobbly.  If the farmer did not keep one hand firmly on the plow, the other hand holding the reigns of the unruly oxen, and both eyes focused on the path ahead, the furrow would quickly become crooked.  Inefficient farming and a waste of energy.   \\n\\tWithout ignoring the past, a congregation in transition needs to stay focused on what is happening in this moment and what God is calling it to in the future.  How do we learn to live together differently, to truly engage the “fruits of the Spirit?”  Hands to the plow, looking forward with a sense of urgency; I believe this is how we slowly renew and re-vitalized our ministries together.  Showing up for one another in worship, engaging each other respectfully in fellowship and service, doing the personal inner work where we feel anxious or sad or annoyed, praying fiercely for one another and for the new Board of Directors.  These are the parts of leadership that everyone needs to pick up this summer.  Challenging tasks ahead for us. Necessary and urgently possible.  Amen.',\n",
       " 'June 2, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tAscension Sunday C\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\tLuke 24:44-53\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\tActs 1:1-11\\n\\n “DOWN, UP AND OUT!” \\n\\n\\n\\tFirst, I need to make a confession.  I stole this sermon title…..and then I tweaked it.  I liked the zippy way a certain UM pastor from Virginia used first century language to described this curious story of Jesus being lifted up into a cloud (Rev. Bass Mitchell, from Hot Springs, Virginia, weekly Bible study blog). “Up, Down and Out!”   It seemed to capture the flow of the astounding post-Easter accounts for us:  Jesus goes UP to sit on the right hand of God the Father Almighty, the Holy Spirit comes DOWN on Pentecost to comfort and empower us and the disciples, and finally everyone is sent OUT to continue Jesus’ mission.  “Up, Down and Out!”   Movement, action; it’s sprightly, simple and clear!  Amen!  Is it time for lunch?\\n\\tBut then I realized that, while catchy, this little ditty didn’t do justice to where we are in the post-Easter Biblical story.  Still using first century language, I decided re-order the directions here:  Down, Up and Out.  Jesus comes DOWN at birth at Christmas, he rises UP finally at the Ascension and sends his disciples OUT to minister in his name.  But in the Biblical narrative, the Holy Spirit doesn’t come DOWN to empower his followers until NEXT week, on Pentecost.  So, I tweaked the good reverend’s sermon title…and I am probably tweaking YOU ALL at this point with this weird geographic language.  Because we have a problem here: You and I do not live in a DOWN UP DOWN world.  Modern science has clearly told us otherwise; no UP or DOWN in space! And now this wild story appears, after Jesus, having been killed, has reportedly been presenting himself as alive, for 40 days, speaking about the Kingdom of God.  What do we make of all this?  How do these stories lead us to better understand: “who is this Jesus?”\\n\\tWe can’t really tell from the Biblical record just when Jesus stopped appearing to people after he died.  It’s all a bit vague, and many of the recorded stories seem to contradict each other when it comes to time and place.   Our two scriptures today are probably written by the same author, and were originally one scroll called “Luke-Acts.”   The author is writing for his Jewish-Christian community in the late first century.  These people have a strong sense of Jesus’ continued spirit working among them and are immersed in an oral tradition which has passed on stories of his works and his teachings.  These people are also familiar with this idea of important people ascending up into the sky.  This imagery may seem ridiculous to us.  But for first century readers, stories of heavenly ascents were pretty common.  Different prophets, like Elijah and Enoch, were remembered as being lifted into heaven. The Roman Emperor Augustus ascended in a similar manner, supposedly in full view of the Roman Senators.  Same with the Greek hero Heracles, among others.   Authors used this ascension imagery as a literary device to confer divinity on a human.   These ascension stories about Jesus became more important as the early church struggled with understanding how Jesus might have been BOTH human AND divine.  Jesus hung around, in one form or another for the symbolic 40 days, a Biblical number relating to a time of spiritual preparation, then he….well, departed. Or perhaps a better way to say this is: “he was exaulted.”  In some way or another, the Biblical writers are saying Jesus goes cosmic.  Now he is everywhere.  And Jesus’ teachings that the kingdom of heaven, the reign of God, is within you, starts to make more sense.  But the problem remains: what do we do with these stories that incorporate a world view that is so radically different from ours today?\\nI think sometimes we get stuck asking the wrong questions about scripture.  Sometimes I feel myself getting perplexed and huffy and frustrated: “what in the world does this mean?”  But this week I bumped into another way of making sense out of the Bible.  For a moment, try on this way of approaching the text: “what kind of people do we need to be for this make sense?”  This is the question posed by the Biblical scholar Mark Branson, seminary professor and Methodist minister.  He didn’t mean, you must be a perfect person, or a totally faithful believer or take the Bible literally.  Rev. Branson affirms that there may be a deeper, metaphorical meaning to a particular story, one that tells us about the all-pervasive presence of God, as known through Jesus.  But if we are only looking to receive this as information, in our head, it won’t do anything to us.  When we read the Bible, we have to start out with the openness to being changed.  In my experience, none of the Good News of the Gospel makes a darn bit of sense unless I am willing to take the risk of being a recipient, a host, for God’s transformative possibilities.  Until I am willing to let go of some control in my life and be willing to change.  Rev. Branson’s suggests that if we always approach a Biblical text with “what the heck does this means?  we miss letting Scripture change us.  Yes, he writes, we interpret Scripture, but it also interprets us.  How is God forming us as we read this passage?  “Go out and be my witnesses to the ends of the earth,” Jesus said.  What kind of person do I need to be for this to make sense?  Not necessarily a pre-rational, non-scientific person.  No.  But I need to be a person open to more than cognitive brain-knowing and fact finding.  I need to be open to a deeper, intuitive, riskier heart-knowing for this promise of the on-going presence of the risen Jesus to make any sense.  For it to change who I am and how I act in the world.\\n“Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying; “don’t impose your faith or beliefs, but be ready to witness to the fresh and transforming experience of God you are having!”   Be a part of a faith community where you work together on being accountable, where we name it when we make mistakes, where we learn to forgive each other as we reach out to those in need beyond our doors.  Be part of an intentional community where people can study scripture together, disagree in love.  Where everyone gets to be heard, all perspectives can be shared, because God speaks uniquely to each of us and these perspectives need to be shared for the good of the whole!   Be a part of a faith community where you are willing to be changed, for the sake of others.\\n\\tWithout being formed by God through learning/soaking in the scriptures, and immersing ourselves in transformative experiences of worship, I don’t see how we are going to have the motivation and the inner juice to serve in Jesus name over the long haul, for the sake of others.  Sure, we can do it, out of the goodness of our hearts… but our egos will get all caught up in being good givers, pleasing someone other than God, working tirelessly because we think it is the civic thing to do.  Our identities then get caught up in being the ones in charge of all the do-gooding.  We get defensive and resistant to different ways of doing things.  The church is not a civic organization or local non-profit; the church is an alive body; it is Jesus’ hands and feet in a particular time and place, and must be led by people open to inner formation.  Because it is the power of God’s transforming spirit that actually equips, empowers and sustains us to serve in Jesus’ name.\\n\\t  “Go out, be a witness to the things you have seen while you were with me,” said Jesus to his disciples.  “Be a witness,” I hear him saying;  “be ready to share the Good News of the transforming experience of God you are having!”  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",
       " \"December 30, 2018 \\t\\t\\t\\tFirst Sunday in Christmastide\\nFirst Congregational Church UCC\\t\\t\\tJohn 1:1-5, 14-18\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSirach 24:1-12\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nTHE WORD MOVES IN\\nThis stretch of days at the end of December is always a bit strange. After the heightened anticipation of the weeks of Advent, the familiar carols, flickering candles and shining faces of Christmas Eve, feasting and present-giving, things feel strangely quiet. For some among us there is a wash of relief after Christmas. Houseguests have headed home, grandkids are again our adult children’s concern, diets hopefully return to normal, decorations are getting packed-away.   The frenzy of festivity, the expectations and extra demands, even great joy itself, can be exhausting.  For some among us, Christmas is a trying, lonely or unusually sad time.  In the midst of treacly Christmas treats and glitzy décor, grasping for the Christmas spirit can be exhausting.  What was that all about, we might wonder to ourselves. Warm fuzzy feelings and perfect presents and successful family gatherings?   \\nI watch the snow fall and the temperature drop; I realize I’m yearning for something more, a blast of clarity about all this.  What difference does it make in my life, in our life as a church, that God comes to us in Jesus of Nazareth?  I do treasure the Gospel of Luke and Matthew’s tender symbolic stories of sweet baby Jesus. Immigrant child survives against all odds!  But after a while, my heart and soul need a theological diet change.  On this First Sunday after Christmas my brain is quietly pleading:  Yes, yes, I heard the birth stories again.  AND NOW WHAT? What on earth do we progressive Christians mean when we consider this very strange metaphor of God among us in the flesh?  How might this change the anxiety and helplessness we feel about our hurting world? How does Christmas change our judging others and ourselves, our merry-go-round of proving our self-worth? How does Christmas change our wondering about whether or not we really have God’s attention?  Or wondering if we really even want God’s attention at all?  And why did I eat all those cookies, anyway?\\nFor starters, I find that the Gospel of John is a good antidote to an over-abundance of Christmas sweetness and baby stories.  This is in part because the Gospel of John includes nothing about the tender birth narratives of Jesus.  All those place-and-people oriented details that the other Gospel writers, Matthew and Luke, reveled in?  Augustus and Herod, weird pregnancy announcements, long journeys, the shabby stable, shepherds freaking-out, foreign astrologer priests trudging after a star?  “Limits the scope!” I can hear the author John muttering to himself. \\n\\t\\tSo what does he do in his Gospel that is different from the other three?  John unhinges us from the narrative detail and goes prehistoric and cosmic at the same time.  I find this startling but refreshing. I’m grateful the Bible includes such diverse stories about Jesus’ origin and purpose, and that our tradition honors our individual choices in this matter.  John’s context as he explores “who is this Jesus” -?  As a scholarly Hellenist of around 100 CE, John is writing in Greek for his Greek speaking Jewish Christian community, under Roman domination, in Jerusalem.  “,In the beginning was the Word,” he writes, riffing off the creation story in the Hebrew scriptures from Genesis, where God speaks the universe into being.  But John gives creation a new twist: Instead of “In the beginning when God created the heavens and the earth,” John writes, “in the beginning was the Logos” – a familiar word in Greek philosophy meaning both “logic” and also an animating energy.  Life energy of the universe, there in the beginning of all things. This life energy, this logos, this word, has become flesh, John will unfold.  Not an abstract philosophical formulation, but flesh!  Certainly a challenging, even ridiculous, notion for any good Hellenist…..who would insist on the tidy separation between fallible bodies/debased matter and the elevated spiritual world. \\n\\t\\tBut John’s community was also filled with Hebrew speaking Jewish Christians.  The “Word” – dabar in Hebrew – also meant the Torah – their holy Law – believed also to be an animating force that existed at the beginning of creation and as co-creator with God.  Jewish listeners would be reminded of lady Wisdom, of the spirit of the Torah.  They would hear these echoes from the Book of Sirach, Wisdom “coming forth from the mouth of the Most High” and “covering the earth like a mist.”\\nJohn is juggling a lot here, seeking to describe an indescribable mystery of God made flesh in Jesus.  Hear his repeating, tumbling litany:\\n\\nIn the beginning   In the beginning  - a time before time, eternal time?  The Cosmic Word appearing with a capital W.  Yet eternal!  There from the beginning.  Speaking, calling out, creating, making it so.\\nMore repetition     WordWordWord.\\nGodGodGod – the name God repeated eight times.  This story is not really about Jesus, the Gospel writer seems to be urging.  It’s about God!\\nBeingbeing.  LifeLife.   Creation keeps springing forth.  \\nAnd there is….. Darkness! – one reference.  The image then vanishes into the whoosh of repeating brightness -  Light Light Light Light Light Light….   \\nAnd then…..WorldWorldWorldWorld  - eternal Word with a capital W coming into the temporal World  - two realms colliding, inter-penetrating, co-existant.  Always. Forever and ever.\\nBelieve believe! – absorb this, trust this, we are urgently invited.\\nFlesh Flesh, the author tries to clarify.   Familial language: Only Son   Only Son\\nThen almost shouting, full of Grace and Truth!    \\nThis Jesus, see him and see God, the writer seems to groan.  Hear him and hear God. Grace upon grace. Grace on grace on grace.\\nAnd finally:  This is the one.  Close to the Creator’s heart.\\n\\nThis stuff shakes me out of my post-holiday stupor of rich food, revelry and gloomies.  I picture animating primordial energy, exploding across the cosmos.  Like stardust from the Big Bang, this energy settles on my skin, sinks into me, flows in my veins.  No, wait, new image, a Cook County friendly image! The Life Energy of the Universe makes a dwelling, a tent, and camps out with us in the everydayness of our lives.  And, oddly enough, within this metaphorical whirlwind, John makes the curious claim that the Word, Christ, actually exists before the human Jesus is born.  The apostle Paul will later write in one of his letters, Jesus Christ is the very one “in whom all things hold together.” (Col. 1:15-20)  Cosmic Christ, cosmic glue?  \\n\\t\\tI’m already on overload but wait there is more! This Word – it shines!  It comes as light.   It is not overcome by any darkness.  And this is what may be so counter-cultural about the Gospel message, in a world like as ours filled with such darkness.  A world filled with such imperfection, so seemingly broken.   Whatever happens with the infusion of the Cosmic Christ, it does not take away the darkness.  This radiance shines in the darkness.  \\n\\t\\tIt was the contemporary poet and song-writer Leonard Cohen who wrote:\\n\\nRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering\\nThere is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\\nFrom Anthem,\\xa0Leonard Cohen, 1934 – 2016\\n\\t“There is a crack in everything.”  Well, yes.  And don’t we know it, deep down in the quiet of the night when we can’t sleep, in the disappointments of missed connections at family gatherings, the sense of inadequacy or resentment or guilt or whatever that overwhelms us even when we try our hardest.  We attempt our “perfect offerings” and sometimes they are successful.  But many times those “perfect offerings” are presented by a mask of who we think we should be…., not the real vulnerable cracked us who is connected to all the other vulnerable people with cracks. I sense we are all cracked-up in one way of the other.  Perhaps our post-Christmas challenge is to pay attention to how the adult Jesus will encounter people at the places where they were cracking – blindness, debilitating illness, people who were paralyzed by fear, shame and hopelessness.  Jesus will move also into the cracks between the acceptable people and the marginalized people….between religious rulers, the wealthy, the political elite and those living in poverty, the outcast, the powerless. Jesus was never looking for perfection….He looked for the cracks of vulnerability where people might receive him….where the light of healing and reconciliation can get in.  Will we move closer towards revealing those cracks? Might it be possible that through the cracks of our vulnerability, transformation, change can happen?  I sense that the spirit of the Cosmic Christ is looking for those cracks in us still.  \\nRing the bells that still can ring. Forget your perfect offering.\\nThere is a crack in everything. That's how the light gets in.\\nIn this cracked, messy and beautiful world our job is to respond to the Living Word that has moved into and is present in all of it.   Jesus is close to the Creator’s heart, says the Gospel writer, and is our guide to God’s workings among us.  “How it all works” is revealed to us as we keep our eye on Jesus this coming year.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\",\n",
       " 'August 4, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost 8C\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke 12:13-21\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tHosea 11:1-11\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nBEING RICH TOWARDS GOD\\n\\t\\n\\nMoney, possessions, acquiring stuff, treasure.  Almost half of Jesus parables deal with the connection between our money and our spiritual well-being:  The dangers of wealth, focus on possessions and the disparity between the rich and the poor was one of Jesus’ favorite topics.   I’m puzzled when many parts of the Christian church stay myopically focused on debating sexuality and gender roles, private sexual morality and sexual orientation.  Because Jesus talked much more about money.  He seemed to have an uncanny sense that the way we use money reveals a lot about who we really are, and where the deepest priorities of our hearts truly lie.  In today’s Gospel reading, Jesus pushes us to an awkward, vulnerable place as he teaches about our relationship with money.  \\n\\tAs we consider today’s text from Luke, it may help to note the context for the story.  A huge crowd had gathered that day; the Gospel writer Luke notes a few verses earlier that people were pushing and trampling on each other in their eagerness to hear Jesus.  Right before this interchange about finances, Jesus is speaking privately to his circle of close followers.  He warns that they should not be afraid of their bodies being killed.  And in the same breath, he reassures them that even the sparrows are not forgotten in God’s sight, and therefore the disciples are not to be afraid: God values them even more than the sparrows.   This is a telling preface to today’s story:  you may die, yet your security lies elsewhere.  Your security and safety lies in God’s valuing of you.  Let your heart sink into this, says Jesus.  Do not be afraid.\\nAnd, Jesus listeners, begin faithful Jews steeped in the Hebrew scriptures, would have also been familiar with today’s reading the prophet Hosea.  They would know this parenting metaphor - of how God is like father who tenderly lifts his child up to his cheek, like a mother who patiently teaches her toddler to walk.  God the loving parent whose “compassion grows warm and tender” even when the wayward child does not repent.  Whose anger does not turn into wrath, but urges God’s offspring homeward.  This is the God who waits to hear from us, yearning like a loving parent.   This is the wider context in which the disciples hear what Jesus says next.  And at this point they may well be asking themselves: God values me but might let me be killed? What’s God’s valuing of me worth?  \\nWhile the disciples are chewing on this paradox, all of a sudden someone in the large crowd calls out to Jesus:  “Teacher!  Tell my brother to divide the family inheritance with me!”  Jewish law at the time prescribed that the oldest son would normally receive double the younger son’s share of any inheritance.  The disciples are probably rolling their eyes at this rude interruption.  Once again, Jesus gets triangled into someone else’s conflict!  But as Jesus refuses to mediate this family feud, he shifts his attention to what may underlie the man’s request:  Friend….take care!  “Be on your guard against all kinds of greed; for one’s life does not consist in the abundance of possessions.”   Jesus zeroes in on our accumulated stuff and what it means to us.  “Where your heart is, there your treasure is also” Jesus warns.\\n\\tA few summers ago, fires were raging throughout my former home-state of California.  And I got a phone call from Deborah, my close friend and United Church of Christ clergy colleague.  She was on the brink of losing all of her possessions.  Her family’s simple home was located in the rugged terrain of rural Big Sur, in the path of the massive fires sweeping down the Central Coast of California.  From the safety of a friend’s house in town, Deborah described to me her frenzied midnight evacuation from her beloved home built by her husband.  They had quickly gathered some art work, a few photos, their passports and tickets to the Carmel Bach Festival, as they fled their canyon neighborhood.  And at that point, they were still waiting for news about their house.  “What would I grab,” I wondered to myself.  “What is most important about my stuff?  What do I value the most?”   Facing today’s text from Luke, I remember Deborah’s phone call and have to ask myself:  What is my connection to my material possessions?  Where does MY heart really lie?  Does all my stuff keep me from seeing and responding to what is most important in the life in front of me?  \\n\\tJesus, after refusing to mediate a family dispute about inheritance of property and money, tells a short parable.  Known as the story of the “rich fool,” this teaching story describes a successful person who seems quite prudent and not foolish at all.  His land produces an over-abundance of crops and he carefully finds a way to store it and reap the benefits.   Certainly it is a wise move to construct larger storehouses; there might be famines in the near future!  Here we have the recognizable paradigm of a self-made man, enjoying the well-earned fruits of his labors!  These are treasured American ideas!  But there’s a catch:  before he can enjoy much of this, the man dies.  “This very night your life is being demanded of you,” says God in the tale.  What?  An accounting?  There is no talk of the man’s final destination or judgement, heaven or hell.  Yet, something about his encountering God in death is linked with all that the man has prepared, has gained, has focused on as his treasure.  But where did the guy go wrong?  It’s possible his accumulated wealth entailed the exploitation of workers, the reduction of resources for others in the community.   But notice what is missing in his story:  The man expresses no gratitude to God for his abundance and he shares nothing with anyone else. \\n\\tWe read more closely and notice this guy says “I” and “my” a lot!  I’m going to do this, consult only myself, then I will do this with all my stuff.  Not much “we” here, is there?  Then I’m going to sit back and congratulate myself.  Self!  Soul!  You’ve done great; relax and enjoy yourself!   Paragon of virtuous independence!   I’m afraid we tend to love this kind of story.  The rugged individual; self-made person deserving of what he or she manages to accumulate.  And is defined by it.  Hard worker!  So why does God call him a fool?  Is it because this man imagines he lives in isolation?  Who else had a part in all of his success?  Where did he get his land from?  What color was his skin?  Did he start out in priviledge?  He makes no acknowledgement of participating in an abundance that comes from God through the gift of the earth, the land that his servants till.   He is self-absorbed; he takes no delight in nor gives thanks for God’s graciousness.  He displays no notice of, nor care, for neighbors in need.  No connection, no sense that he is part of the family of God.  \\t\\n\\tThis may be at the core of why wealth is problematic.  It’s not wrong; it’s just risky.  It can be isolating.  It can make us forget about connectedness and inter-dependence.   We assume that we can secure our future and our safety.  We assume that our belongings, our treasure, can in some way save us.   And we put our heart there.\\nAs I spoke with my friend Deborah that day, I could hear the concern and sadness in her voice.  But she did not sound afraid.  I sensed a steadiness in her, as she spoke of the many, many people, the connections that she had established over the years as a religious leader, as an environmental activist and community volunteer.  These connections were now enfolding her.  She spoke of the web of prayer, from people around the world, that surrounded her.  Yes, her simple cabin home amidst the redwoods and eucalyptus trees was a treasure to her, but it was clearly not where her heart was.  In the middle of the fearsome, overwhelming power of a seemingly unstoppable forest fire, I heard her faithfulness, her sense of safely in God’s presence.   I give thanks for Deborah’s witness to where our true treasure might be.   I give thanks for Jesus who understood this so perceptively and guides us this day in re-locating our own hearts.  Like a loving parent, God so desires richness for us:  A richness that give thanks.  A richness that seeks the well-being of others, as well as our own.  How might we each grow “rich towards God?”  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTHIS REFUGE OF GOD’S LOVE\\n\\n\\tI find it rather curious to hear these two scriptures passages this morning.  They seem to inhabit two different spheres: the Psalm – private prayer between the author and God.  A song of praise, thanking God for God’s loving presence that is steady presence through thick and thin.   From conception through the present, God being our refuge, our fortress, a safe place.  And then Luke’s description of Jesus’ very public start to his ministry.  It’s an abrupt conclusion to the story we read last week:  Jesus is first received with welcome approval by his hometown as he speaks in his synagogue.  But in today’s finale he proceeds to royally tick-off his neighbors.  To the point where they want to throw him off a cliff.   Jesus seems to pick a fight and it is hard to feel God’s steady, loving presence in what he has to say.  Comfort in the Psalm, and an unexpected challenge, even judgment, in Luke’s passage; a strange contrast.  Two different ways of understanding God’s action in our lives.  \\n\\n\\tMoving first into the scene in the synagogue, let’s see if we can figure out what the great teacher of “loving our neighbors as ourselves” is doing… besides raising people’s hackles.   Beginning his ministry, Jesus has traveled around speaking in different synagogues throughout Galilee.  Here, he returns to his hometown Nazareth and attends worship in the synagogue with what are probably family and neighbors.  He takes a turn reading from the Hebrew scriptures; his portion is from the prophet Isaiah.  It tells about the Messiah, the expected savior of Israel who will bring good news of rescue to the poor, and release to the captives, and healing to the blind, and the start of the Year of Jubilee - all signs of God’s in-breaking reign of mercy and justice.  Jesus sits down, everyone is staring at him, and he says to those assembled, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.”  Hmmmm… …murmur several people, interesting….isn’t this Joseph’s son?”  Can’t you see them nudge each other: “I remember when he was just a boy, helping in his father’s carpenter shop!”  No one seems too disturbed at this point.  But then Jesus launches into a rambling diatribe, declaring that the congregation is getting ready to oppose him.  Putting words in their mouths, he suggests they will demand some kind of favoritism, special miracles like he did in other towns, because he their hometown man.  \\n\\n\\tJesus finishes off this rude assault with provocative references to great Jewish prophets of the 9th century BCE:  Elijah and his disciple Elisha.  Each of these men was known for showing God’s mercy and compassion to outsiders.  Apparently, this is what finally infuriates the Nazareth crowd, because these are references to their history when they, the chosen people, did not seem to be favored.  In the first case, the prophet Elijah ignored needy Israelite widows during a famine and brought aid to a Phoenician widow, restoring and empowering her to new life.  In the second, the prophet Elisha chose among many needy lepers to heal a Syrian military commander of his leprosy, restoring and empowering him to new life.   The widow and the commander were both Gentiles, outsiders.  Jesus is in the synagogue congregation’s face: The healing power of God’s kingdom is to extend to those we consider to be outsiders. \\n\\n\\tAnd the people get it and they are “filled with rage.”    Perhaps they realize that when the marginalized are truly empowered, it tends to change the status quo.  Our resistance to this, as the insiders, seems naturally ingrained, because it may mean loss of advantage and privilege. Loss of a way of life that we might feel is already threatened.  I think this is the root of the tension between urban and rural parts of our country, and also at the center of our immigration debate.  The fear of losing “things as they have always been” may be even be part of our contentiousness as a small town and also as a congregation. I wonder, how do we deal with these stresses and fears in ourselves?\\n\\n\\tRowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury and head of the Anglican Church has been known for inviting outsiders into conversation.  He would invite those out on the edges of British society and outside the Anglican Church, into open dialogue about spirituality and faith.  Out of these experiences, he wrote Tokens of Trust: An Introduction to Christian Belief.  He focuses on the idea that belief is more an act of trust than intellectual assent.  Belief is less about a right or wrong set of ideas; it’s about an action, a trusting. For Rowan Williams, belief in God is trust in a loving relationship.  This is the core the Psalm today: having a trust that in some essential way, we are held safe.  I do not believe the Psalmist spoke of a fantasy safety where we will never be ill or injured or die.  It is more the interior safety that comes from a growing awareness of an anchorage, a refuge that holds our very being.  Outward circumstances may shake it this trust, but cannot destroy it.  To illustrate, Williams compares Christian affirmation or belief in a loving God with the “formula used by Buddhists when they make their statement of common purpose to their community: (A Buddhist will say) ‘I take refuge in the Buddha’, meaning, “the Buddha is where I belong, the Buddha is what I have confidence in to keep me safe.”  Again, not immune to human frailty and suffering.  But, again, this interior safety.  What Williams is getting at is that our beliefs aren’t primarily intellectual ideas; they are really descriptions of a place, an inner anchorage in love, where we “find solid ground, home.”   “In you, O Lord, I take refuge,” wrote the Psalmist years ago.  What a marvelous breath-prayer to take into our week:  “In you” (inhale and pause).  “I take refuge “ (exhale and pause).   This sense is not automatic, but builds with daily contemplative practice, prayer, meditation, soaking in scripture.  \\n\\nJesus intuits his eternal refuge in God’s love; it’s what enables him to do his ministry of teaching and healing in spite of the opposition.  His refuge in God was not a place of safety.   But it is what empowered him to push the assumed boundaries of God’s mercy, even when gravely threatened.\\n\\n\\tPerhaps the Nazareth congregation wondered: (New Testament scholar Matt Skinner):   “what if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?”  Is this historic practice of the Jubilee year with forgiven offenses and debts too much?”    One NT scholar writes of our reluctance to be too generous: (Skinner takes a provocative leap himself in an article entitled “Immigration Reform and the Challenges of Generosity). We “resist outsiders and their empowerment,” he writes.  In the immigration debate, “To empower certain people toward citizenship scares many in America,” he continues.  “Do we fear loosing our advantage, our privilege?”  he asks.  In our fear, do we loose track of supporting family unity and hard work and people in need?  “What if too many outsiders get embraced by the Kingdom of God?” asks Skinner (Odyssey Networks, 1/29/13 posting).\\n\\n\\tOur toughest challenge as church is to be the kind of place where theological, economic, sexual orientation and political diversity does not unravel our loving interactions here.  Perhaps our greatest witness is to provide this experience of loving refuge, as it flowers in our patience and kindness with one another.  We will be better able to reach out to the outsiders and those disempowered beyond our doors.  All this is made possible as we take refuge ourselves in the living, loving God.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'January 19, 2020\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond Sunday in Epiphany\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\tValues Sunday 10:30-noon\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\tI Corinthians 12:12-27\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nTHE BODY OF CHRIST\\n\\n\\tIt’s kind of an odd way to talk about the church, isn’t it?  The Body of Christ.  The Apostle Paul uses this image in a letter to a church he had started in Corinth (present day Greece).  It was a bustling first century urban metropolis, a sophisticated Greek city.  Those who received Paul’s letter would have been familiar with contemporary writings of Plutarch, the Greek historian.  Plutarch  used the Body image to describe the political state.  And in their political state, the lower class plebeians and peasants were lesser than the high-class wealthy people.  The term “political body” would have been familiar to Paul’s congregation.  They were used to this comparing of a human body to a group of people.  \\n\\tAt the point he writes this letter, Paul is one of the early leaders of the small group of Jesus’ followers.  He has traveled all over the western Mediterranean talking about the teachings and presence of Jesus, and forming small communities of the early church.  He gathered such a group in the city of Corinth, in which people of all different social classes, slaves and free people, rich and poor, would come together to talk, pray, sing, read scriptures and share a meal of bread and wine at the Lord’s Table together.  They would make sure everyone had enough, and that there was food and money left over for the poor.  But they were all so different.  They struggled with getting to know each other, hanging out together, listening to God’s direction together.  Paul writes in his a letter to them that he knows this is hard, because they are all so different.  “You each bring different spiritual gifts to your congregation, for the purpose of the common good,” he wrote earlier in this letter.  “Keep working at this,” Paul pleads with them, because, “you are in fact the Body of Christ on earth now.”  Paul takes this commonly used body reference out of the political realm and applies it to their spiritual community.   “Jesus the Christ is no longer walking around on earth, but his spirit is with You…. His Spirit dwells in each of you and all of you together.”  To try and explain this amazing idea, Paul says:  “You are the Body of Christ, and individually members of one another.  You are the hands and feet, eyes and ears, belly button and toes of Jesus Christ here on earth!  You are all connected.  You matter to each other.  No hierarchy.”  Unlike the political state, implies Paul, you are all of equal importance to the whole.\\n\\tAt our Board of Directors meeting earlier this month, I asked them to do an exercise with me.  Think of this church, I said, imagine this church, as the living Body of Christ.  Imagine it as a body, a person.  What?  Yes, try it.  If this church were a body, a person, right now, what would it be like?  Well, they thought and imagined….and started to share.  Try it yourself.  What would you say?  What do you see when you think about this?  A man or a woman?  Gender-fluid, called out one Board member.  About how old would you say this body, this person, is?  Baby boomer, someone else commented.  What kind of shape is it in?  Been injured, is recovering.  Has a chronic condition!  Needs on-going attention and symptom management!  What is important to this person, I asked?  What challenges does it face?  What does it value?  Which brings us to the task at hand today.  What does the Body of Christ here on the corner of 2nd and 3rd, actually value?   When we are at our best, what core values guide our choices, our behavior, our witness in this community? \\n\\tI love how the ancient writer Paul talks about how the parts of the body all belong together.  All of us play different parts in the body and are all connected to each other.  The hand can’t say to the foot: I don’t like you very much, you don’t belong here.  Paul says that when one part of the body suffers, all suffer.  I think of that when we share joys and concerns.  We are happy and we are sad, all of us, depending on what is happening to each individual member.  Pushing the image a bit further….what part of the body are you?  What abilities and gifts are yours to share for the increased well-being of this body?  How is God speaking through your imagination about our church today?\\n\\tAs you now move from this Sanctuary Into small groups, you will be invited to think about what this body might look like in the future.  You will be asked to consider the year 2025, to think “outside the box” and wonder together about what kind of vibrant ministries might be happening here at that point.  You will be asked to imagine that 5 years from now, something about the creative and dynamic ministries of this congregation has caught the media’s attention.  A newspaper reporter has written an article about our church’s vibrant, engaging, ministries out in the community.  What would we be doing out there beyond our doors?  Picture being a truly vibrant and transformative church.  What would relationships be like among all of you?  “Members one of another,” wrote Paul.  What would your connections with and impact on the wider community be like?  What values would be most evident?  I invite you to imagine what that would look like.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'December 29, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFinal in Gospel Series\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t         \\t\\tFirst Sunday after Christmas\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn 1:1-14\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tJeremiah 15:16\\n\\n\\n\\nMany Voices, One Story:\\nJOHN TELLS ABOUT JESUS\\n\\t\\n\\n\\t\\tThroughout the weeks before Christmas, I shared a series of “first person” sermons.  Each Sunday I “took on” the persona of three different New Testament author: Mark, Matthew and Luke.  I was able to ham-it-up a bit as I pretended to be a 1st century disciple, speaking to you, 21st century followers of Jesus.  We considered each of the authors’ different historical settings and audiences for their writings, as they sought to tell the story of Jesus’ life and purpose from their perspectives. In relating how Mark, Matthew and Luke each described the birth or public arrival of Jesus, we explored how each of them give somewhat contrasting views on the life and person of Jesus.  Different ideas about how and in what ways Jesus becomes, in the words of the early church, God incarnate, God-with-Us, Immanuel, in human flesh.  \\n\\t\\tToday we come to the gospel of John….and somehow, I just couldn’t seem to deliver this sermon as John in “first person”   Maybe it’s that his Gospel is so very different from the other three gospels, and I have always found his words and his worldview a bit perplexing and even unsettling.   Yes, there can be something erudite, rambling, off-putting about John’s gospel.  I almost have to hold it at arm’s length.\\nBut it’s worth exploring, in part because it contains the strangest birth story about Jesus yet.  In hearing how John introduces Jesus, we might wonder: What happened to our familiar Christmas birth narrative?  Where are Luke’s  angels and shepherds heralding the baby Jesus’ birth, the focus on Mary?  Where are Matthew’s tender Joseph, the Three Magi  visiting the baby and King Herod trying to kill the baby?   Weirdly, none of this appears in John’s Gospel.  \\nEach Gospel writer begins by is trying to describe WHEN the Incarnation happened.  For Mark it happened when the adult Jesus stepped forward to be baptized and God adopted him as his anointed child.  For Matthew and Luke, it happened when Mary miraculously conceived and gave birth to Jesus; God gets intertwined with humans through paternity.  For John, the Incarnation happened way before any of that, before God’s creation of the universe!  Different perspectives, lots to chose from!\\n\\t\\tAs time went by, and each of the four gospels were written, the circle of new Christians spread wider and wider into non-Jewish communities.  With John writing in the early 2nd century CE, we now have an author who was very Greek and used the language and symbolic world of the Greeks who had mixed with the middle eastern world.  He uses un-Hebrew-like words and concepts like “logos” meaning “logic,” (abstract word used by the early Stoic philosophers) “light and darkness,” and “life.”  The Jesus we know through John is repeatedly speaking of his coming so people could find life and find life abundantly!\\n\\t\\tInstead of short, pithy moral teachings, John’s gospel is filled with long philosophical discources, that most likely are not Jesus’ words verbatim.  Again, its important to these four gospel books are theological documents, not historical biographies about Jesus.  Everything in the gospels is seen through the lens of the community empowered, in the present, by the Risen Christ.  And we see this no where more clearly than in John.  For starters, John does not mention a Baby when he presents Jesus to his readers.  With strange poetic language, the author introduces Jesus, God Incarnate, by going both prehistoric and cosmic at the same time.   Let’s look closer at the scripture reading on the back of the bulletin:  Notice how the words repeat themselves, in a tumbling litany:\\nIn the beginning   In the beginning  - echos of a time before time, eternal time?  The Cosmic Word appears with a capital W.  Eternal, cosmic Word of God, there from the beginning.  Speaking, calling out, creating, making it so.\\nMore repetition…..     WordWordWord.\\nGodGodGod – the name God repeated eight times.  This story is not really about Jesus, the Gospel writer seems to be urging.  It’s about God!\\nBeingbeing.  LifeLife.   Creation keeps springing forth.\\nDarkness – one reference.  The image then vanishes into the swirl of repeating   brightness -  Light Light Light Light Light Light.\\nBecoming more specific now:  TestifyTestifyTestified – spoken words pouring forth - John the Baptizer has foretold it!\\nWorldWorldWorldWorld  - eternal Word with a capital W coming into the temporal world  - two realms colliding, inter-connecting.  \\nBelieve believe! - we are addressed, urgently invited.\\nFlesh Flesh,  - the author tries to clarify.    \\nOnly Son   Only Son\\nThen almost shouting, full of Grace and Truth!    \\nThis is Jesus, see him and see God, the writer seems to groan.  Hear him and hear God. Grace upon grace.\\nAnd finally, this tender whisper:  This is the one.  Close to the Father, close to the Creator’s heart.\\n\\t\\tWith this mishmash of abstract Biblical references and imagery, John leaves me overwhelmed, a bit breathless.  Frankly, his words shake me out of my post-holiday stupor of rich food and revelry.  But John’s Greek listeners would find nothing strange in this cosmic perspective, as “word” or “logos” means logic in Greek.  In the beginning was logos, logic, the mind of God and it was with God and the mind of God, the intelligence was God. The philosophical Greeks loved this stuff.  But…where is John going with this?  He also is connecting with his Jewish readers, as delight in the “Word” of God, in the teachings of the Torah, was sacred to all Jews.  The prophet Jeremiah’s image of finding God’s words and eating them, symbolically consuming them into one’s being because they are so precious, gives us a sense of how central “Word” was for these people.   \\n\\t    John chooses symbolic, poetic language to help people better understand “who is this Jesus?”  Who is this one we are ALREADY experiencing in the midst of our community as the Risen Christ?   Now most Greek Christians and bi-lingual Jewish Christians would be with John up to this point.  John describes Jesus as the agent of creation, as the source of “life,” as a light that shines in human darkness and evil.   But it is in verse 14 that John makes his bold move:  “And the Word became flesh and lived, dwelt among us.”  The Greek word for “dwelt” actually is derived from the word “tent.”  Can you hear the echoes of God of the Hebrew Exodus, who dwelt, tented with the Israelites in their wanderings in the desert wilderness, in the sacred tabernacle and also in the firey pillar that went before them?   \\n\\t\\tAnd this is where John’s words edge up on the “scandal” that Apostle Paul describes in his letters to the early churches.  High-minded Greeks, for whom bodies and the material world were an awkward mess, found this idea rather repugnant:  This logos, that has always been here, has now entered the world in a deeper, fuller way.  John’s words jump off the page at this point:  This one who has dwelt among you has now has become incarnated, put on human flesh!  God has become incarnate among you, sharing in your joys and pains here in earthly flesh.  And in receiving this one, you too have the “power to become children of God.”   Which makes us siblings, doesn’t it?  Brothers and sisters in Christ; an unlikely mix of folks all in one family of God.   Because we are human, are part of Creation, this Word, this Jesus, is all tangled up in us.  Revealed in us.  Working in us and the person sitting next to us and the person on the other side of the world we have never met.  Sound, mysterious, huge and confusing?  You bet.   \\nIt’s a stormy grey Sunday after the soft glow of Christmas.  The houselights have come up….. and “wham,” and here is the real deal: Christmas isn’t just about warm fuzzy feelings and presents and family gatherings.  For us in the community of believers and seekers we say that God is here with us in this newborn baby; God is for all of humankind.  The God who spoke and created creation, still speaks this creating power today.  In each of us and in all of this messy, chaotic and beautiful world.  And our job is to listen to and respond to the Living Word that has moved into and is present in all of it.   “How it all works” is revealed to us as we keep our eye on Jesus the Christ. May the poetic mystery and challenge of John’s Gospel continue to challenge and transform us.  Amen.\\n\\n(followed by time for silent reflection)\\n\\n\\t\\t ',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTHIS SEARCHING GOD\\n\\n\\n\\tAnyone who does laundry on a regular basis knows the agony of the lost sock.  You’re folding the dry shirts and sheets, deep in the endlessly repeating cycle of dirty clothes getting clean.  And there it is:  another darn sock without it’s match.  Actually, the lost sock is not really the problem.  What is now troublesome is this now “left-over” sock.  Leftover glove or mitten, a metal nut without a matching size bolt. There is a “forlorn lostness” to this solo item.  Funny how these small, everyday circumstances around our home can sometimes put us in touch with deep feelings and wonderings.  We might be reminded of other lost things and broken pairs in our life.  Like a friendship or a marriage, or a loved one who has died.  An adult child who seldom calls anymore, or an adult child who seems to have lost adulthood and struggles with finding a satisfying worklife, emotional stability.  We might think about the loss of a beloved church member who angrily departed or who drifted away and stopped coming to worship.  Lost socks: Memories get snagged and we suddenly find ourselves mulling over the realities that run below the surface of our everyday lives.  At times we ourselves may feel lost, or a part of ourselves seems to have gone missing.  Perhaps it was a lost opportunity, a sense of optimism, a certainty about our abilities.  Or that secure feeling that God really was there for us. \\nJesus of Nazareth had an uncanny ability to recognize and search out lostness; people lost to themselves, people lost to their communities.  He wanted people to know that lostness, and the grief that can accompany it, matters to God; God somehow knows and aches with all this human lostness, isolation, disconnection, separation, endings.  Maybe that’s why Jesus hung out with marginalized people who were lost to society, to their community and its supportive fellowship, lost to themselves.  And Jesus chose to do a radical and intimate thing:  he frequently shared meals with these lost people.  \\n The two parables we just heard from Luke are told by Jesus in reaction to the grumbling of some local religious leaders that Jesus’ actually sits down to eat with “lost” people.  Both tax collectors, specifically, and generalized sinners, people who broke Jewish law, were considered to be “lost” to society, sullied individuals who should be avoided.  These rules may seem foreign or even ridiculous to us, but Jesus was breaking what was known as the Jewish purity code by hanging out and eating with corrupt petty officials, people with deformities and illness, and sex workers.  In their defense, the Pharisees and scribes did have the unity and well-being of the whole community to consider.  The suspicious and repressive occupying Roman enforcers were always to close at hand.   Jesus overhears these Jewish legal scholars complaining and tells these two stories about lost-and-found.\\nThese are disarmingly simple stories about seemingly trivial items: one single sheep and one small coin.   “Which one of you would not leave your whole flock; what woman wouldn’t use up lamp oil to find one small coin?” Jesus asks the crowd.  “uh….that doesn’t sound wise,” I can hear people muttering to each other.  What kind of smart herder risks losing a whole flock to find one lamb?  The image is over-the-top; it doesn’t make sense.  Stranger yet, shepherd is an unlikely role model for God who searches for the lost.  In Biblical times, shepherds were considered shiftless and dishonest, dirty and ritually impure themselves. The next story is just as exaggerated.  A woman loses coin valued at about one days labor.  She uses up precious lamp oil and time to search her house.  She finds the coin and invites her friends to “rejoice” whereby they all start partying in celebration, using up more of her meager resources.  The Lord God of the universe is like a persistently searching shepherd, like a diligently searching woman?  This sounded odd to Jesus listeners.  Jesus implies that God not only searches for the lost, the misfits, but God wants to feast in an extravagant and seemingly wasteful manner and celebrate how all the lost people are welcomed in.  No wonder the religious leaders found Jesus irritating.\\nAccording to Jesus, God is out there searching, persistently looking, not waiting for those on the margins to be included.  Not waiting for us, in our own disoriented sense of “lostness,” to finally see that we could have a closer connection to the Creator of the Universe.  No, Jesus seemed to think God is actively pursuing us.    \\nWhat does it feel like to be subject to this kind of search?   Do you find it reassuring….. or does it creep you out to think of God searching for you?  We talk a lot in the liberal church about how we welcome all seekers, and how important our own individual search for God and truth and mystery is.   We want to make sure we have the freedom to seek out God on our own terms, without someone telling us where that search should go or what the discoveries might be.  Perhaps there is some hubris in this insistence?   We bring a strong sense of independence and carefully guarded skepticism to our search for God.  But if God is looking for me, it seems to take away my control of this process!  Will I be judged, even punished, once I am found?  Will God demand something really difficult or ridiculous of me?  \\nHere is where I find the matching of the Luke story today with this passage from Exodus to be unexpectedly revealing.   I caution us about a literal reading of this supposed interchange between God and Moses.  We can get distracted by focusing only on:  “just how did a conversation between a person and God get recorded?”  Think of this narrative as a parable, like stories Jesus taught.  It’s recounted as Jewish sacred history, its recorded so people can know what God is like.  And it’s a mind-bender!  This is a scene from the Israelites’ time in the wilderness, following the escape/Exodus from enslavement in Egypt.  They are pretty lost themselves at this point, uncertain where the promised land is and how to get there. They also seem to be losing a sense of their emerging identity as God’s people.  Their leader Moses keeps going up to the mountain to commune with God, and this time he hasn’t been back for days.  Aaron has been left and is valiantly trying to keep the peace among the lost, the worried and restless families.  They want something to follow, some symbol of this mysterious God who is supposed “will go before them and lead them.  Aaron suggests they take all their gold jewelry and melt it down to form a golden calf.   “Tomorrow shall be a festival to the Lord” Aaron proclaims when they were done.  They all bring burnt offerings and celebrate in front of what they considered to be an image of the deity that has brought them up out of Egypt.  God gets whiff of what is happening down below and confronts Moses.   Whether they were actually worshiping other gods or simply ached for a symbolic representation of their one God and Lord, the text isn’t quite clear.  It was to be a “festival to the Lord.”  What is clear is that God is pictured as furious, going on a rant, pretty much disowning these people who seem to have lost their senses and their connection with God.  \\nMoses and God argue back and forth, almost like two parents trying to pass the blame for their disobedient child.  No, she’s your child!  No, she’s your daughter!  Well, whatever….I’m at my limit here with these people! says God.  But what happens next is that God changes God’s mind.  God actually repents, so the story goes.  God changes God’s perspective.  Yes, it does sound terribly anthropomorphic.   But I find this image compelling.  If God can change God’s perspective and repent, reorient, then….maybe you and I can too.  We are after all, made in God’s image, according to our Creation stories.  Maybe that’s the beginning of letting myself be found.  Stop, open myself to a new perspective, repent, reorient, be ready to receive.  It’s another over-the-top story, but the Hebrew writers wanted people to know that God is persuadable and extremely passionate when it comes to human beings.  \\n\\tThis is the God who searches us out in uncertain times in our lives, transition times as congregations and tumultuous times as a nation.  Watch this week.  How is God searching you out?  Watch for invitations to stretch your imagination, to welcome lost parts of yourself, to open yourself to those who seem different.  Maybe there will be a spontaneous invitation to rejoice and feast together with all kinds of unlikely characters.  Let’s keep our eyes and ears open.  Someone, infinitely mysterious and passionately close at hand, is searching for each of us.  Thanks be to God. Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nBUILDING THE BELOVED COMMUNITY  (sing first verse)\\n\\n\\t“Once to every man and nation.”  Once to every woman and nation, I would add.  In spite of its gender exclusive title, this hymn by James Russell Lowell never fails to stir and challenge me.  A 19th century poet, editor and diplomat, Lowell was the son of a Congregational minister.  Lowell was also an active abolitionist, working with his wife Maria White in the New England anti-slavery movement.  Our hymn is part of a longer poem called “The Present Crisis,” which Lowell published the poem in Boston in 1845, as a protest against US involvement in the war with Mexico. Lowell was convinced that land added to Texas would only increase the territory of permitted enslavement of certain humans. After a portion of the poem was set to music, it was often sung in many New England Congregational churches, which felt called to anti-slavery work. “Once to every man, woman and nation, comes the moment to decide, in the strife of truth with falsehood, for the good or evil side.”  These denominational ancestors of our United Church of Christ believed that the then prevailing “truth” of black people’s inherent inferiority to white people was a “falsehood.”  For them, “time (had truly) made ancient good uncouth.”  \\nThe tone of the hymn is somber, even gruesome at times: we walk a path “by light of burning martyrs,” tracking “Jesus’ bleeding feet.”  Yet, I experience an odd mixture of feeling both chastened and hopeful as I sing the words, challenged again and again by the phrase, “new occasions teach new duties, time makes ancient good uncouth.” \\nAs a nation, I believe we are at an interesting confluence of “new occasions” this last week.  MLK Jr birthday, a impeachment trial, today’s Winter Congregtional meeting…… I find myself wondering: “what new duties” are being revealed to us as disciples of Jesus? In a time when politics has sharply divided us as a nation, we so want the Jesus story to NOT be about politics.  \\n\\tBut the Gospel of Matthew wants his readers to know that Jesus’ public ministry begins in response to a political act:  Jesus learns that John, his cousin and most likely his spiritual mentor, has been arrested and jailed by the local political ruler King Herod.  Jesus leaves his hometown and heads to Capernaum on the Sea of Galilee.  And, “from that time” on, writes the Gospel of Matthew, “Jesus begins proclaiming ‘repent, for the kingdom of heaven has come near.’”  Jesus starts with a message about not about getting to heaven when you die, but about…..politics!  About governance, who is in charge and about how choices are made in this public realm.  He says that the kingdom that rules the heavens, the reign of God, has come near.  The first public words out his mouth are a radical political proclamation about the nature of our life together as a body, polis, community.  And these words will eventually pit him against the political powers of the day and get him arrested and jailed and crucified.   \\n\\tWe are on the edge of a communally fraught time for our nation.  New occasions that are challenging us with new duties, in the words of the Lowell hymn.  Last week began with our annual celebration The Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. birthday, in an era when racial inequity around housing, jobs, rates of imprisonment and health care, and resulting racial tension, continue to soar.  Dr. King often used the Biblical phrase, “the beloved community.”  He spent his public life addressing the interwoven realities of racism, militarism and poverty, which he claimed conspired together to keep our nation from being such a beloved community.   Mid-week, we witnessed the beginning of the Senate impeachment trial, of our current President.  We continue to experience deep, angry and chaotic divisions in our country, in our leadership and general population.  As a church, we are slowly starting to emerge out of a time of hurtful divisions in our own congregation, but have a ways to go before we are a healthy and revitalized ministry-focused church.  This is the reality, the context, in which this Matthew passages drops today.\\nIn the midst of all this, we encounter Jesus the adult, who starts his public ministry by saying the reign of heaven is coming near.  And then he does this very odd thing of going up to a couple of fishermen and saying “follow me, I will make you fishers of people,” and the guys drop everything, I mean everything, and follow him.  Leaving nets and catch and boats and family?  Not a prudent move, it would appear.  One Biblical scholar (Warren Carter) has noted that Jesus appropriates the word kingdom, used by the Roman empire, and slyly strikes at the heart of mighty mperial Roman rule.  “Kingdom of God is at hand!”  Not, “the kingdom of Caesar.”  One might say that Jesus is referring to regime change.   God’s kingdom, reign of justice, mercy and peace, as opposed to the way that the ruling Roman’s operate, is happening here. The “beloved community” God intends is at hand, it draws near.  Jesus is going to start acting like his very presence, his teaching, his healing work, extends this regime change and reveals it.  And who does he invite to join him first?  Fishermen.  Not the local scholars or politicians, or soldiers, not the bakers, artisans or tax collectors.  All three gospels, Matthew, Luke and Mark, tell us his first students, followers, are fishermen.  Historians hold this is significant because the fishing industry of the time was more fully embedded in the imperial Roman economy that just about anything else.  (Warren Carter describes how) “Rome asserted control over the land and sea, their production, and the transportation and marketing of their yields with contracts and taxes.”  Boats, nets, your catch, where you pulled up your boat, who you sold to, prices, all regulated by the empire who also takes a huge cut.  Professor Carter continues: “Jesus disrupts these men’s lives, calls them to a different loyalty and way of life, creates a new community, and gives them a new mission (fish for people). His invitation to them exhibits God’s empire at work, this light shining in the darkness of Roman-ruled Galilee.”  Come, follow me, and I will make you fishers of people.  Now we move to the relational, the building of this beloved community.  It’s going to be about how we live together, govern ourselves under God’s rule.\\n\\tThis same Biblical scholar (Warren Carter) notes that Jesus will go on and heal people who have actually been physically damaged by living in the inequities of the Roman imperial system.  Jesus comes and starts to “repair imperial damage.”  At least 70-90% of the inhabitants of the region were living in poverty.  Food insecurity, unclean drinking water, social stress, poor nutrition, frequent imprisonment and hard physical labor just to survive.  Many of the illnesses that Jesus will cure are caused by these kinds of unjust conditions: body weakness and paralisis, blindness, mental instability, fevers.  Jesus “enacts God’s life-giving empire.”   When I read this, all of a sudden the healing stories of Jesus seemed more radical, more seditious, than I ever imagined.  I also realized how closely these conditions of first century people’s lives parallels that of people of color in this nation today.\\nMartin Luther King, Jr. called our nation to repair “imperial damage” of centuries of racism, militarism and poverty.  And it was very hard for much of our nation to hear him.  And the damage continues.  Is the current US Senate trial, in a sense about “imperial damage” having been done to our nation?  What do we each want to say to our elected Senators about this?  Closer to home, some would say this congregation has sustained damage.  And there is considerable disagreement about how and why certain damage to people, relationships, structures and programs actually happened.   But how might we move beyond the narrative that this is a troubled, declining church and get on with wider ministries of “damage repair” in our wider community and world?  The conflict in the apostle Paul’s first century church in Corinth was due to an emphasis on individual freedom over the well-being of the whole congregation.   Will we seek to both honor our diversity of perspectives yet still be “united in the same mind and same purpose” as the apostle Paul urged the conflict-ridden church in ancient Corinth?   I think this is possible.  I think this is beginning to happen among us, as “new occasions” are bringing us new challenges and “new duties,” as a church.  “Speak and act so no one will doubt you are brothers and sisters in Christ,” Paul wrote to his friends in Corinth.   And may it be, increasingly so, for us.  Amen.\\n\\n()',\n",
       " 'May 19, 2019 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tFifth Sunday in Easter C\\nFirst Congregational United Church of Christ \\t\\tActs 11:1-18\\t\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tRevelation 21:1-6\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nA NEW HEAVEN AND NEW EARTH\\n\\tOur scripture texts offer a curious mix of visions this morning:  from Revelation this strange image of a new heaven and new earth with a holy city descending like a bride. And from Acts, Peter’s bizarre dream of forbidden animal foods piled on a big sheet.  As we weave our way through these seemingly disparate texts, I invite us to hold in our mind’s eye the interpretive tool of the church potluck.  It may give us some clues about God’s intentions.\\nChurch potlucks, a beloved tradition in a wide variety of congregations, have been the brunt of media jokes for years.   Saturday Night Live “Church Lady” parody; quips about typical Lutheran church cuisine on Garrison Keillor’s “Prairie Home Companion.  Because much of my ministry was spent in California, my potluck experiences are quite mixed.  I remember standing in one potluck line following an ordination service in a foody-sophisticated Marin County congregation just north of San Francisco.  I was joking with a colleague about the difference between San Fernando Valley farming communities church potlucks of jello-salad and bean-mushroom-soup-canned onion rings fame and this spread before us of fresh salmon, leafy salads and piles of artichokes and aioli dip.   Looking back, I realize I had not only disparaged certain regional food of the Valley, but that I had also made a somewhat classist comment.  Years later I moved to Minnesota and more humbly acquired new potluck vernacular as the mysteries of tater-tot hot dish, lefhsa and dessert bars soon revealed themselves.  Clearly, food can unify and it can divide.  It can make you feel at home; it can make you feel like a stranger in a crowd.  Inclusive, exclusive.  \\nAs we look at this passage from Acts, we might well wonder what all the food fuss was about for the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem.   It was well-known that Jesus ate with all kinds of people during his ministry.  But, following his death and the spread of the Gospel message, these city folks were questioning the Apostle Peter about his associations with outsiders: “Peter, why are you eating with those uncircumcised, Gentile people?  You know their food choices do not adhere to our sacred purity code!  You become impure yourself by eating with them; their food may have already been offered to idols!”  This conversation may seem like splitting hairs to us: kosher, non-kosher, ritually clean and unclean food..  And Paul has already eaten with the Roman Centurion, Cornelius, and affirmed the receiving of the Holy Spirit by Cornelius and his entire household.  This is beyond our contemporary debates and accomodations around certain dietary restrictions.  Food was a deep religious identity issue for Jews, as they struggled against assimilation under the dominant Roman regime.\\nHow might Peter’s strange vision, of a sheet descending down from the sky and filled with all kinds of animals and birds, give us a glimpse of God’s new intentions?  How did a curious assembly of edible creatures, all of which were considered non-kosher, unclean, give this observant Jewish apostle of Jesus an intuitive flash of God’s new directions in redeeming the world?  For those who know Hebrew scripture, this jumble of animals on a table cloth would remind the of  heavenly banquet table imagery: the arrival of God’s reign of justice and peace where everyone is included at the table.  Not unlike a welcoming church potluck, it is a vision of all kinds of people bringing all kinds of food.  Think about it:  church potlucks are a place where we enact God’s inclusive reign on earth: gather together, no boundaries, we trust in each other’s cooking abilities and cleanliness standards and we try new things.  \\nPeter recounts this bizarre vision to the Jewish Christians in Jerusalem who still believe that followers of Jesus, of the Way, should also adhere strictly to Jewish dietary and circumcision laws.  Peter has been of similar mind, but something has started to change within him as he sees so many different kinds of people drawn to the teachings and presence of Jesus.  One commentary I read this week notes that Peter’s act is “boundary deconstruction.”  (working preacher ref, May 19, 2019). The Jerusalem leaders could have kept Cornelious and his household at arms length, until they passed some probabtionary period as new Christians.   But apparently God has little patience with this kind of border keeping.  \\nWe might think about new people coming to a congregation.  Over the years, I have observed that the presence of new people inevitably changes the culture and the future of that church.  But this is often problematic for those who have been around for awhile, like those who were raised as Jews within the centuries old Jewish tradition.  In an effort to explain not only why he was sharing food and lodging with gentiles, Peter has to justify why the Roman (gentile) centurion Cornelius was allowed to be baptized as a new Christian.    We might well imagine Peter’s own revulsion to this dream of clearly non-kosher animals such as pigs, shellfish and reptiles, tumbling together on the descending cloth.  But apparently God is not too concerned by what seems unusual, even distasteful to us.  This may be important to remember as we find ourselves resisting certain changes in church institutions. \\nPeter continues with his story in front of the circumcised believers in Jerusalem.  “And not only that, but then these men from Cornelius’ house appeared, who were obviously Gentile, and the Spirit told me to not worry about that but to head to the town of Joppa and preach the good news to this entire household of Gentiles, Cornelius’ very house, and the Holy Spirit fell upon them just as it had upon us at the beginning!”  “Now tell me,” continues Peter,  “my brothers and sisters in Christ, who was I that I could hinder God?”  And the room of Jewish Christians in Jerusalem fell silent.  They are reminded of their own prophets’ insistent teaching that God’s intention was to reach out beyond their religious tradition to include the whole world in redemption.  Suddenly these Jerusalem Christians break into praise, proclaiming, “Then God has given even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life.”   Interesting.  The conserving, resistant element in the Jerusalem group was able to look back at the best of their own tradition, and with that reminder they were able to discern the way forward into change.  This gets me wondering, in what ways have we been “hindering God” around here?  When has this congregation been at its best and how might elements of that legacy move us forward in this transition period?\\nWe also might do well to pay attention to what we find to be off-putting, a tad disturbing as we move through the coming days.  Where is God calling each of us deconstruct borders, to break down exclusionary walls?  Surely, we will each bump into someone, some situation this week, some new idea around here, that will make our nose wrinkle or our stomach churn.  We are bound to encounter a part of humanity that we would just as soon exclude from our circle. The new person at church that has a few too many unusual ideas or someone in a same sex relationship or speaking with a foreign-sounding accent, someone with just too many tattoos or the wrong color skin or their gender expression makes us cringe.   We might want to pay attention to our discomfort, as we move through the various circles of our days.  Our discomfort may be a signal for us about the new thing that God is up to next.  Like God giving “even to the Gentiles the repentance that leads to life” we read in the Book of Acts.   \\nAs if a tablecloth full of animals and birds isn’t enough strange metaphor for one Sunday, the author of Revelation presents us with vision of a city radiant and holy as a bride, descending to earth.  Frankly my inner feminist bristles at  this bridal imagery, but again, I remind myself, think metaphorically!  In the ancient world, cities were invariably represented by the feminine.  Roman sculpture often depicted conquered cities as shackled female slaves.  How’s that for the denigration of a certain gender?  The author of Revelation, writing under the cover of metaphor to challenge Roman rule, is doing something different.  In this pointed political diatribe denouncing the vile, gaudy, imperial corruption of the Roman Empire, he envisions God redeeming our whole planet.   This is different from modern day misrepresentations of the Book of Revelations, such as the Left Behind series.  Here we have an image of God embracing our material world and making the earth itself new.  There is actually no rapture or snatching up of faithful Christians away from nasty earth in this book.  “See,” says the loud voice from the throne, “the home of God is among mortals; God will dwell with them; they will be God’s peoples.”  \\nThe author’s vision doesn’t talk about escaping this place of repression; it describes earth being transformed.  Earth being the place where all will be saved from injustice, all barriers and tears wiped away, where repressive systems will be dismantled, mercy and reconciliation will reign. God here, in our dwelling and living, breaking down barriers, even in our sharing church pews and potluck with one another.   How then will we, First Congregational UCC, be part of God’s barrier-deconstructing plan?  How will we be part of this new heaven and new earth?  We have much to explore together in the days to come.  Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'First Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost 17\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEphesians 2:19-22\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tI Corinthians 12:12-27\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS THE CHURCH FOR TODAY?\\n\\n\\n\\tI sometimes wonder what it was like to receive a letter from the Apostle Paul, like the ones we consider today.  The young churches in Ephesus and Corinth were both in major cities and centers of commerce, filled with a variety of people from all over the Roman Empire.  In the midst of their squabbles and struggles over leadership and how to be church together, they get these messages from their founding pastor Paul. He has heard they have problems.  I am struck by the way Paul invites them to take a step back, to “go up to the balcony” so to speak, and consider who and what they are as church.  \\n\\n\\tPaul’s actually like a good marriage counselor who won’t allow the couple to stay stuck in a blame game of finger pointing.  In all of Paul’s 100 references to the word church in his letters we have preserved in the New Testament, he is never refers to church as a building.  The English word “church” is translated from the Greek work ekklesia, which means assembly.  In Paul’s day it meant a particular assembly or gathering of those who follow the way of Jesus.  In these passages we just heard, Paul is asking the ekklesia, the assemblies in these Asia Minor cities of Ephesus and Corinth to consider a wider view of church. It’s like a marriage counselor who hears the frustrations of past interactions and hurts and says to the couple, “well, let’s see if we can envision what you would want your marriage to be like.”  The counselor invites the couple into considering the marriage as a third entity in the room, besides the two partners.  The two don’t become one, they become three!  This third entity needs attention, re-imagining, care and feeding.  How will they sustain this precious relationship in the future?  I suggest that the Apostle Paul is inviting us to do the same today; take a step back and consider a wider historical perspective about church, and ponder together about how these images of being an assembly of followers of Jesus might inform our way forward.\\n\\n\\tPaul speaks of the church community in a wild mix of ways:  the ekklesia is a not strangers or aliens (the word used to refer to those Rome had conquered) but a group of citizens in the household of God, a temple, a holy dwelling place for God, the Body of Christ.  Let’s be careful not to hear these metaphors through the assumptions of later politicized Christendom, when the church claimed to be the only way to God and everyone else is damned.  Paul is simply talking to those who have chosen to follow the way of Jesus, together.  He uses numerous other metaphors for church that we won’t even get to today:  ekklesia as family, children of God, bride of Christ, city on a hill, light to the nations. I suggest we sink into a few of these metaphors and see where they lead us in our thinking about being an assembly in this time, in this place.\\n\\t I’ve worked with churches as an Intentional Interim Pastor over the years, many who were emerging out of a time of conflict. Underneath the debates, I sensed a stuckness.  I would notice a sense of loss over what church has been in the past and an unacknowledged unraveling of shared assumptions about its future.  People would talk about their Congregational heritage and how the church is run like a democracy; everyone gets a vote and no one from the outside tells them what to do.  “Wait a minute,” I would think to myself, “this isn’t all of our Congregational heritage.  Something is missing here!”  \\n\\n\\tA fellow United Church of Christ pastor from Massachusetts, The Rev. Martin Copenhaver gave a recent talk to the Massachusetts Conference of the UCC, and it reminds me of this missing piece.  Martin was also concerned by the contentiousness and conflict he experienced in many church meetings.  Looking back at our American church history he writes: As our Congregational ancestors came to this country in the early 17th they “felt called to a different kind of church than what was represented in the state church, the Church of England.”  Most importantly they believes that  “no individual—be it a bishop, priest or lay leader—is fully equipped to discern and follow God’s will. “These early Congregationalists believed that the workings of the Holy Spirit could be discerned in community by receptive hearts that are molded in prayer. Indeed, the very name “Congregational” derives from the understanding that it is the congregation, informed by scripture and molded in prayer, that is best able to discern what Christ would have them do. They put into practice their understanding that the gathered community is the true vessel of the Spirit of Christ—a term that they used often. They met often and their meetings were seen as opportunities to encounter God in their midst.” (“Discernment and the Congregational Way,” Keynote Address to the 209th Annual Meeting of the Massachusetts Conference, November 1, 2008 by The Rev. Martin B. Copenhaver) \\xa0\\n\\tYikes.  Our gatherings, our deliberations, will only draw us closer to God and one another, and to serving God’s wider purposes, if we are “informed by scripture and molded by prayer.”   That’s our heritage…..that’s the continuing purpose of the wider United Church of Christ of which we are a part.  Without each of us individually soaking in and praying on the Biblical language our church decisions become based on our own individual preferences.  They are based primarily on our own sometimes clouded thinking and a projection of our personal needs.  Then we take a vote on whose preferences “win.”  \\n\\n\\tIt was difficult for the church in Corinth to not let the accustomed hierarchies of the Roman world infiltrate their community of worship and service together.  Who had the most money, who had been around the longest, who has the highest stature or influence in the community; wouldn’t these naturally be the “deciders” in the congregation?  But Paul offers this image of a body, one that was common in Roman culture for reinforcing the need for a “head” who bossed people around and “hands and feet” that did all the dirty work.  No, says Paul, you all, you the church, the gathered assembly, are the body of Christ.   He’s using metaphorical language to get his readers to think outside of the box.  Thinking about Jesus who taught, died and was raised from the dead is not just idea to consider.  Paul insisted that the spirit of the risen Christ, the Messiah, is so intimately present in the gathered body of followers of the Jesus Way, that they become like a living organism together.   Interconnected, like a foot and a finger and an arm and a neck are to a human body.   And this living organism needs care and respect.  I think we need to pay attention to this metaphor.\\n\\n\\tI received two immunizations this week as part of my annual physical.  “Which arm?” asked the nurse as she laid out the shots before me.  “How about one in each,” I answered confidently.  “You want both arms to be sore?” she quipped.  “Uh, no.  Go for the left arm.”  Later I had to laugh, as the ache and lack of mobility in my left arm was enough to throw my whole sense of well-being off kilter.  One arm, two arms….whatever…..my whole body was affected because my arms can’t say: we don’t belong to the body.  Arm hurts, body hurts.  Even in the midst of our disagreements as a congregation, I sense we are experiencing some of this body awareness that Paul describes:  We all ache at some level.  He speaks of our need to honor the weaker parts of our communalness, that there may be no dissension within the body, but the members may have the same care for one another.\\xa0 If one member suffers, all suffer together with it; if one member is honored, all rejoice together with it.  Holding one another to accountability is one thing.  But mean-spiritedness and disparaging of one another seldom builds up the Body of Christ that is us.   It hurts the whole body that is us as church.\\n\\n\\tThere is a curious tenderness to Paul’s images of church.  In his letter to the Ephesians, there is none of the “church triumphant” militaristic imagery that will regrettably emerge in later centuries as Christianity aligns with political power.  Here, Paul urges this mid-first century congregation to be who they are: a dwelling place for God. Almost as if the church is where a new politics is practiced, where “a different kind of power, the self-outpoured, boundary-cross power” of God is poured out.  Where we learn to “trust this power, letting it undermine every wall (that comes between us, until we are ‘built together spiritually into a dwelling place for God.’” (Brian Petersen, from http://www.workingpreacher.org/preaching.aspx?commentary_id=3748).\\nOf course we are not the only dwelling place of the divine, denigrating other spiritual traditions. But we are a collected people who are a temple of God’s spirit.  We are not totally complete but are ever growing and renewing ourselves as this temple. “You are being built,” Paul reminds the Ephesians.  I think that’s us, Church!  We are an on-going construction project of the Spirit, an assembly of Jesus followers, a living organism, a precious dwelling place that needs our prayerful and tender care.  Amen. ',\n",
       " 'April 18, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\tPalm Sunday, Year C\\n1st Congregational Church, UCC\\t\\tLuke 10:28-40\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\tPhilippians 2:5-11\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nTHIS JOURNEY WITH JESUS\\n\\n\\tIt’s Palm Sunday, the traditional beginning to a week of big and awful things that happen to Jesus of Nazareth in Jerusalem.  I’m also aware that you and I and the rest of this congregation are beginning a new, transitional time of ministry together, one filled with A LOT of mixed emotions and concerns.  As I grappled with these two scripture texts this week, wondering how we might begin our transitional interim ministry together, I came upon a Biblical commentary for Palm Sunday, written by one of my seminary classmates.  After graduation, Barbara Brown Taylor was one of the early woman priests ordained in the Episcopal Church.  A gracious southerner, she became a rising star in the predominately male field of Episcopal priesthood.  She’s an insightful, earthy preacher, a popular spirituality author and speaker.  I once heard Barbara describe fumbling deep in the loamy soil of her Georgia vegetable garden to harvest potatoes.  She said this unseeing, dirty work helped her learn to reach towards God’s mysterious and often hidden presence.   Getting our hands grimy and our fingernails black in the search for God!  It seems we are often looking for God’s guidance in the dark; probing in the grim of life, grasping; and it roughs us up, it changes us.  Recalling that image, I found her linking of these two Palm Sunday texts was helpful for me.  She writes: You want details about Holy Week, about the events of Jesus’ final night with his followers, his arrest, arraignment, torture and death?  Go to the Gospel reading in Luke.  Are you wondering about “the attitude that determined Jesus’ actions every day of his life, including his last?” – go to the Epistle reading, this letter from Paul the apostle to one of his early churches. (Feasting on the Word, Year C, Volume 2, page 171).  Outer actions; inner attitude.  I suggest explore both this morning.\\n\\tBecause here we are today, entering the most sacred week within the Christian year, watching Jesus enter first century Jerusalem on a crowded holiday filled with Passover celebrants.  We already sense this won’t end well.  And here we are today, listening to the early church leader, Paul, reminding a conflicted and polarized congregation from over 2000 years ago that they must be of “one heart and one mind” by taking on the “mind of Christ.”   And…Here we are today, only weeks after Pastor Beth Benson’s abrupt departure amidst disagreements, hurts and tremendous upheaval in this church.  And we aren’t really sure how this reconciliation process will end.   In a sense we are fumbling in the dark, reaching blindly through a lot of dirt.  We are expectantly searching for something fruitful, sustaining and hopeful as we move ahead together as a church. \\nSo let’s dive in.  At this point in the Gospel narrative, we find that Jesus’ audiences are resonating with his message that the Kingdom, the reign of God was at hand.  The crowds who watch Jesus enter Jerusalem are straining against the increasing tax burden and offensive, idol-worshipping presence of Roman rule.  They are appalled that statues of Roman leaders have been installed in their house of worship, the rebuilt Temple.  Caesar, the Roman Emperor, is now to be addressed as “the Son of God.”  What may be difficult for us to appreciate is how very closely their political situation was of deep religious concern to Jesus’ contemporaries.  It is within this complex, first century historical context, that we need to hear the Biblical narratives of Holy Week.  \\nFor the crowds in Jerusalem on this particular Passover feast week, they would be celebrating their release from slavery under the oppressive rule of Pharoh, hundreds of years before in Egypt.  Memories would also be fresh of the Jewish Maccabean revolt against the brutal Hellenistic ruler of Israel, Antiochus Epiphanies, about 150 years before.  When the Maccabees returned triumphant into Jerusalem, re-taking the city, people threw palm branches in their path.  But here we have Jesus, in about 33 CE, performing his own bit of street theater with a non-military and even ridiculous looking entry on a scrappy young colt.  Do the crowds think he will be a militant Messiah, bringing down the Romans with violence?  Are they joining in on the political satire, throwing palms of victory down on the ground before him and thumbing their collective noses at the Roman soldiers?   \\nThese Passover pilgrims are living in their own land, visiting their own holy city of Jerusalem, but it is now dominated by an oppressive power.  Perhaps not unlike how the original native inhabitants of our own country feel living in, for them, an occupied and alienated land. Perhaps some in this congregation feel like they are living in a “conquered” or “alienated” church, dominated by an oppressive power.\\n\\tJews in Jesus’ time would have understood him through their longing for restoration: a social and political re-building of their communal lives together that also involved a wider, universal renewal of all God’s creation; throwing off the shackles of Roman power, a restored Israel would lead a wider world into moral transformation.  Israel as a light to the world!  Prophetic visioning had begun to happen all over the region around this time, including zealots and insurrectionists embracing guerrilla warfare, believing they were living in the last days, and preparing for the coming Kingdom of God.   Charismatic healers and miracle workers, exorcists abounded.  They were all performing signs and wonders that would signal both their intimacy with God and point to the End Times.  Jesus steps onto this stage with a call for a wider type of communal and spiritual restoration than anyone could imagine.  And his vision and actions set him on a collision course with authorities that find his call to restoration unsettling, even dangerous, for an occupied nation. (See Paula Frederickson, From Jesus to the Christ)\\nSuddenly, in the pressing bodies crowding through the city gate, someone shouts, “There he is!  Look, the teacher and healer from Nazareth…he heals the sick, he confronts the authorities!” Another chimes in,  “Surely he is the Messiah about whom our prophets speak!”   But wait, he’s riding this puny colt.  One of the gospels even calls it a donkey.  Not very powerful looking for one supposedly leading an uprising against the Roman powers. \\nThere is something oddly subversive about Jesus’ entry.  Is Jesus is purposely revealing the subversive nature of his own Kingship.  As far as Jesus was concerned, the real power, God’s power, is not about force, manipulation, bigness, shock and awe.  Jesus knew that God’s power intentionally self-limits.  God’s domain is about self-giving.  Empowering peace, compassion and mercy.   Notice that throughout this awful week in Jerusalem, Jesus will spend “no energy protecting himself.”  (BBT).  All we will see is a continue self-emptying.  It’s really quite unnerving to watch.\\n\\tA few decades later, the early Christian teacher and apostle Paul will write a letter to his church at Philippi about Jesus’ attitude, his mind-set of self-emptying.  Reading through this short epistle, one quickly gets a sense that this congregation was struggling with some serious internal power issues.  They were constantly haggling over who gets to decide what, whose opinion matters the most, who wields the most influence in the congregation’s decisions.  In his letter to this first century congregation, Paul encourages the people to “let the same mind be in you that was in Christ Jesus.”  We may hear this as:  “now I want you all to agree on church doctrine and there will be no variation or theological diversity!”  Or perhaps it sounds like another version of Minnesota Nice, where we stare at our shoes and bit our tongues politely, then go complain to a third party. But I don’t think this is what Paul is describing.  Paul speaks of how Jesus “emptied himself.”  Paul says that Jesus,  “taking the form of a slave…humbling himself, becom(es) obedient to the point of death – even death on a cross.”  This is the attitude, the mindset, that determined Jesus’ actions every day of his life, including his last.   Able to see and listen to people with profound openness, Jesus invited others to be suspicious of their own certainties.  Ever curious, he pushed people to observe their own thinking patterns and ego-centric concerns.  (Susan Beaumont, Congregational Consulting Group website, Four Guiding Principles for Managing a Polarized Congregation ,February 18, 2019). \\n This mindset reveals something to us about God’s power, Paul is writing to the Philippians. The mindset of Jesus Christ was all about self-emptying.  Could it be that God’s most powerful aspect is God’s self-giving to us, out of God’s Self?  A God who empties-out God-self for all of creation, humanity, us. He will say in another letter to another congregation: Take on the mind of Christ; let yourself be transformed by the renewal of your mind. This is a tall order.  It takes energy and patience and courage to practice this counter-intuitive kind of mindset.  And it will change us.  \\nI wonder how might we talk about these challenges of “taking on the mind of Christ” as the United Church of Christ in Grand Marais?  What might this kind of self-emptying power look like among us, as we be church in new ways?  For now, Holy week lies before us.  Let us follow Jesus together, through Jerusalem towards Easter.  Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tRevelation 7:9-17\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nOUR SHEPHERD, HOST AND LAMB\\n\\tPreaching on Mother’s Day would seem to be a no-brainer.  The Sanctuary is fuller than usual and the theme is so Biblical sounding: sacrificial mother love.  Pastors often welcome this opportunity to relate such mother love to the generosity and persistence of God’s love for humans.  One can explore Biblical themes of the divine feminine, where God is described as a mother who proactively and even fiercely nurtures and protects her children. We hear echoes of this in the imagery Bobby McFerrin uses in his song paraphrasing Psalm 23. Some pastors relate Mothers’ Day to the seemingly self-denying love of Jesus, echoing a thread of Christian thought that describes Jesus as an innocent lamb sacrificed for all.  Lots of opportunity to explore love from God’s perspective, in spite of the fact that Mother’s Day as we know it in the USA is wildly sentimentalized and commercialized.   \\n\\tAs I considered our texts for today, I found myself wondering about how these shepherd, sheep and lamb images from the Revised Common Lectionary help us better understand the ways of love.  God’s love for us, Jesus as the teacher and revealer of the heart of God, and our loving of one another.   In ancient Biblical times, a good shepherd was used as metaphor for the good king who cared for his subjects and ruled with mercy and justice.  Throughout Jewish history, corrupt and unjust kings were referred to as “bad shepherds” who did not watch out for their whole flock.  Jesus told parables about shepherds, and used the metaphor of “sheep” for his followers who were to listen to and recognize his voice as that of the Good Shepherd.  They “hear” him and follow, and they experience transformed and abundant life in the present.  He also used the sheep metaphor for the flocks of people that the disciples were to minister to in Jesus’ name.   In this shepherd, sheep mix, we find added the early church’s depiction of Jesus as a sacrificial lamb.  Early Christian tombs were often covered with artwork depicting Jesus as a Lamb.  We hear this curious vision from the much mis-interpreted Book of Revelation, that appears to describes how “Lamb at the center of (God’s) throne will be their shepherd.”  Shepherds, sheep, lambs and…...mothers.  Hmmmmmm.   \\n\\tFirst I should say that there a few things that give me pause when it comes to Mother’s Day. This day can get a bit problematic.  It’s not just the cloying greeting cards and the wild mix of expectations associated with this day.  Relationships with our mothers, mother-memories and the experience of mothering are a complicated mix.   On Mother’s Day, the church does well to recognize that this is a tough day for some folks.  Some people may have never met their birth mother or have become estranged from her.  Some of us may have people who became “mother” for us.  There are those among us who have mostly happy memories of our mothers.  But many of us will out live our mothers and Mother’s Day may be a poignant reminder of someone who is now sadly absent.  There are those among us for whom the memories of mother may be a shadowy vagueness at best.  At worst, these memories may be filled with deep sadness, or sometimes even with terror and hate.  Mother’s Day can be a delight and it can be awkward or downright painful.   Let’s not generalize about this tender day, least of all here in our faith community.\\n\\tTo complicate things even more on Mother’s Day, there are a wide variety of experiences related to being or not being a mother.   Joy and grief, missed opportunities and unwanted responsibilities, accomplishment and failure, sin and forgiveness.  Regret, surprise, hope.  Not unlike what God experiences in dealing with humans!  And all of this intricately connected to human love and relationship: trying to love, failing to love, being loved, feeling loved, feeling unloved.  We claim as Christians that God is love.  “Love one another, as I have loved you,” commanded Jesus of his followers.  Given this complicated context of Mother’s Day, what more might we understand about love…..from the Biblical sheep-herding world?   \\n\\tIn encounter after encounter during his earthly ministry, Jesus invited people not so much to believe a certain doctrine about him but to simply to “follow me.”  When asked where he dwelled, he would reply “come and see.”   But it was never a specific habitation; people were invited simply into his presence, into a relationship with him, to hear his voice.  And the resurrection appearances, whatever those were, convinced his followers that this ongoing relationship of compassion and clarity was still unfolding.  The writer of John’s Gospel and his community were experiencing the reality of this on-going connection with Jesus, some 70-90 years after his death. As John weaves together stories about Jesus’ ministry, he wants them to know that this “good shepherd” wants them to grow in love, be brave in love.  Which meant to stop clinging to the places where the world insisted they would be secure, where they would be acclaimed, where they might be powerful.  In the passage from John we just heard, he recounts a conversation between Jesus and the leaders of the Jerusalem Temple.  The Jewish leaders want him to simply things.  “Tell us plainly, are you the Messiah? The anointed one who comes to save Israel?”  They are eager to reduce him to a title, which will allow them to nail down his program:  are you like one of those rabble-rousing rebels, the Maccabeans, who we celebrate on this Feast of the Dedication, the Feast of Lights and Hanukkah?  Let us know, please, because we are wary of allowing threats to the populace, and the Romans are getting understandably nervous about the crowds you are drawing.  Come on Jesus, tell us if you are one of those terrorists for the Lord or not!  But Jesus doesn’t bite.  He won’t let them reduce him to a simplistic title.  “The works that I do in my Father’s name testify to me” he says to them.  It’s as if he is saying: you don’t get it because you don’t participate in this new Way; you don’t belong to my flock, to my sheep…that is….you aren’t following me.” \\nJesus would have grown up hearing Psalm 23, where we are reminded of how the God of all creation as the “good shepherd.”  Most other Psalms use militaristic language when they describe God’s protective presence:  God is a fortress or stronghold; a high place or refuge; all military terms that might fit better with saying “the Lord is my King” or “the Lord is my commander” (Kenneth Bailey, Presbyterian Outlook 2008, “Psalm 23 and Jesus).   This is the Psalm that leads us into some counter-intuitive statements about a loving God: “ The Lord is my shepherd, I shall not want.”  This, in a predominant culture that is constantly convincing us of things we might want and desire.  “I walk through the darkest valley, down the gully, the crevice, and I fear no evil.”  This, in a world where we are constantly worried about security, where we are seek to root out the suspicious looking ones in our midst, from potential terrorists to undocumented workers.   \\nFinally, in a subtle shift, the Psalmist brings us from the shepherd’s field to the dining room, and lifts another counter-intuitive image:  This loving God who works so intimately in our lives as an attentive shepherd is also gracious host.  This God spreads out a table before us “in the presence of our enemies.”  A traditional feminine role, a mothering function.  Love provides food, oil, overflowing cups, abundance.  \\nWe have to practice receiving from God the shepherd, mothering host.  We have to practice because this does not come natural to us.  It may make us feel too dependent as adults.  We are naturally bent on establishing our own security and survival as adults.  Self-preservation!  If we are fortunate enough to have the basics covered, we move on to establishing and preserving our own individual status and self-esteem.  We want to nail other people down with generalizations:  you are always this way, you never do this.  We over-simplify and over-state a situation and cling to our polarized positions, when the reality at hand (in our family, our workplace, our church) is much more complicated. We brace ourselves and we hold on tight.  Consequently, our ears close to the deep, quiet voice of the loving Shepherd. \\nThe irony is that it is only in the daily softening of our hold on this self-preservation program that we become available to God’s loving presence.  It helps us have the security to love bravely.  The invitation to daily prayer practices of surrender and letting go, releasing the places where we cling, slowly guides us into God’s care and then out to love courageously and minister in this hurting world.  \\nWhere might we each encounter the Good Shepherd this week?  Watch for green pastures and cool waters that come your way; notice what happens as you walk through those dark places.  Where will we be invited to sit at the table of this Gracious Host?  Watch for those places of abundance, even with the enemies of scarcity and despair in the wings.  Let the food and the oil and the overflowing cup quietly astound you.  Amen.   ',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nTESTS AND TEMPTATIONS\\nThe season of Lent leads us to several encounters that Jesus has various spiritual entities as well as humans.  And it eventually brings us to his arrest, torture and execution in Jerusalem.  The prevailing mood seems to darken and the visuals are bleak.  Through the slow progression of 5 long weeks, bare branches will grace our altar, echoing the starkness that pervades the still-wintery landscape outside our Sanctuary windows.   It can be an introspective time, if we so choose; and the scripture readings will be challenging.  They raise adult themes about human brokenness and the powers of evil, about a Jesus heading for inevitable confrontation with menacing and deadly authorities in Jerusalem.  \\nIn the early church, Lent was a time to prepare catechumens, adults who had chosen to follow the Jesus Way, for baptism.  Practices of prayer, fasting, scripture reading, almsgiving to the poor were integral to this preparation time.   Lent presses upon us the theological language of confession, repentance, forgiveness.  We will be invited to face some shadow parts of ourselves, our mistakes and limitations.  Not to shame us and make us feel like we are bad, but to experience some good old-fashioned guilt perhaps.  Appropriate guilt about what we want to change about ourselves and change about how we are as a church.  Lent is a time to be reminded that it is in the very messiness of our lives, the imperfectness of who we are and what what we do, God invites us into transformation and partnership. \\nBoth of today’s scripture readings include dramatic interaction between humans, the forces of evil and God.  The Genesis story offers what I understand to be a mythological tale about the first humans, Adam and Eve, complete with talking animals and a mystical garden.  The story is well worth further discussion among us, but for starters:  This ancient Jewish creation story from 10th century BCE is not a scientific description of the how humans appeared on earth, nor a replacement for scientific theories of human evolution.  Nor was the story intended as a condemnation of women (that comes later in church history, as the pervasive patriarchal society begins to corrupt Jesus’ teachings – think “justicification for persecuting witches – 15th century CE).  Also, in the original Hebrew, the serpent is not the devil; personification of evil comes much later, with influences from Persian religion.  Probably most importantly, it is not about original sin either, in my view – an original flawed nature we all inherit because of A and E’s disobedience.  This interpretation arose in around the 3rd-4th century of Christianity, and led to some problematic understandings about the purpose of Jesus’ death.   Further discussion among us needed!\\nIn the Genesis story, Adam and Eve are confronted with the temptation to be more than human and to embrace God-like powers of certain knowledge and immortality.  What’s wrong with knowing good from evil, one might ask?  Perhaps their mistake was claiming a power to divide the world into black and white, into good and bad.  This dualistic way of thinking that has caused no end of problems for humandkind, as we often claim good in us and project all bad/evil outside of us.  \\nSo what to make of this story – that has wrecked such havoc in it’s misinterpretations??!!  It is a foundational mythological tale that attempts to explain our present condition of human life, all its messiness and brokenness.  A life where we often pretend we are God-like as we overreach our limits and then we blame others.  We forget we are created in God’s image: we become ashamed, we hide from God and become estranged from each other.  Good story to ponder in Lent.  \\nThe Matthew narrative is a description of Jesus being tempted in much the same way.  We have no idea if this was a literal encounter with some personalized face of evil, or an equally harrowing vocational struggle within Jesus’ own psyche.    Following his baptism by John the Baptism, he heads to the wilderness on what could be described as a vision quest.  What is this urgency within me?  This sense of God calling me to do…what?  Engaging the time-honored spiritual practice of fasting, honing his spiritual attentiveness, he confronts – what – his shadow side?  Hallucinations?  Matthew calls it “the devil” – which means basically “adversary” in this context.  Forget the red guy with horns and a pitchfork, or visions of Dante’s “Inferno.”  Think poetic language to describe great truth!  Jesus is invited, beguiled, to take on impressive powers that are admired and celebrated in the human kingdoms of the world.  These promised powers will make him great in humans eyes, maybe even spread his message further!   But yielding to these temptations will ultimately run contrary to his purpose.  He is to be the one who preaches the “alternative community,” a kingdom marked by Self-sacrifice, vulnerability, humility.    \\n\\tCan you hear the snear in the adversary’s voice: “If you are the Son of God,” it taunts, “how about this?”  First century listeners to this story would not necessarily associate the title “Son of God” with meaning Jesus was divine.  “Son of God” was a honorary title well known in Judaism:  Kings in the Davidic line during Israel’s golden age were called “Sons of God” and the people of Israel are sometimes themselves called “Sons of God.”  But maybe most importantly, in the first century Greco-Roman world, human emperors were using this title.  “Son of God” was an honorary title for the Caesars, who lived extravagant lifestyles, had the power of a huge army behind them and ruled with an iron fist.  “If you are the Son of God,” the adversary says, “if you are going to be high and mighty like the Caesars….” mocks the adversary. “What kind of Son of God are you, really?”  \\n\\tThe tests that follow are pretty tempting, not so much because Jesus is hungry and tired.  They are tempting because they challenge Jesus to get really clear about what he is called to do and not do in his ministry.  And they are confusingly tempting because they contain partial truths:  “Come on Jesus, I know you are going to be concerned about the needy and the hungry!  Let’s get started here, by turning these stones into bread.  Hey Jesus, God’s reign of justice and peace is a real challenge to earthly corrupt powers.  Don’t you want to have dominion over the kingdoms of the earth so you can get this Kingdom of God thing started in the right way?!”   Finally, the adversary quotes promises from the Hebrew Psalms:  “God’s protection is promised to the righteous who call on God’s name!”  In an ironic twist, the adversary suggests Jesus try this out in the center of Israel’s holy city in the sacred Temple.   “So Jesus, you certainly are righteous; how about you just fling yourself off this Temple balcony?  Go ahead, lean into the promises of the ever gracious and saving God!”   \\nIt’s one thing to say no to something that we know is really wrong.  But what about the places in our lives that seem less clear?   The day-to-day ethical choices that are awash with partial truths, with ambiguity; a simple statement that borders on a tiny lie, a misrepresentation about ourselves or someone else, Saying we think or feel something when we really don’t.  Leaving parts out of a certain story when we talk with our suspicious parent or spouse.    These are the messy places in our lives where God calls us to make the choices that reflect who we really are.  Created in God’s image, beloved, forgiven children of God.\\nOn this first Sunday in Lent, we might well wonder to ourselves:  what would it mean for me to more fully live into God’s will for me, as God’s beloved son or daughter?   What full truth about ourselves, our church, are we each being asked to face this day?  Such are the questions of the Lenten season.  Thanks be to God. Amen.',\n",
       " 'July 21, 2019 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost 6C\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tAmos 8:1-12\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke 10:38-42\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nTO SAVOR OR SAVE THE WORLD?\\n\\n\\tIn considering today’s scripture readings, I am reminded of a brief quote I keep on my desk at home.  It is written by the American author, EB White, best known for his children’s books, Stuart Little and Charlotte’s Web.  It sums up a life dilemma that I face most days.  It’s also the challenge I hear in the writings of the prophet Amos and the Gospel writer Luke this morning.  Here are EB White’s words:\\nI arise in the morning torn between a desire to improve the world, and a desire to enjoy the world.  This makes it hard to plan the day.\\nImprove or enjoy the world?  Savor or save it?  Am I going to reach out in some kind of service to others, or reach in with a more contemplative immersion in God’s glorious creation, quiet soaking in God’s Word, meditative reflection on God’s presence in my life?  Where does a faithful Christian focus?  Inreach or outreach?  Where does a faithful church focus?  Last Sunday, we explored Jesus’ story of the Good Samaritan, and Jesus reminder to the religious scholar that God wants us to love God and our neighbor through our compassionate actions.  “Go and do!” Jesus admonished him.   Improve or enjoy? Save, or savor?  Take care of others or focus inwardly?  Finding a balance between these two ways of being causes considerable debate in many churches.  It influences time spent on ministry programs, what is preached and taught, and how church budgets are constructed and spent.\\nThe Amos prophecy and the Mary/Martha story highlight two different parts of the religious life.  Reaching out in service to others, reaching in to connect with God’s purposes through study and prayer.  But which is most important in bringing us closer to God and God’s call to faithful living? \\t\\nThe Amos passage is tough to hear.  A stomach-churning read, filled with vivid and brutal depictions of God’s coming judgment on the northern kingdom of Israel during the prosperous early eighth century BCE.  The prophet Amos is appalled by his wealthy nation’s religious pomposity and their disregard of their poor and needy. He likens them to abundantly ripe bowl of summer fruit that has reached its peak and is about to come to a rotten end.  He doesn’t mince words about God’s relentless judgment that will befall the people.  The people’s sins are described as moral failures of social injustice. Those with power and wealth have cheated the poor and trampled the needy in their midst.  God has had enough of this and Amos describes God as saying: “I will turn your feasts into mourning, and all your songs into lamentation.”  Historically, the northern Kingdom will soon fall before the military might of the invading Assyrians.  Is there a cause-and-effect connection between social injustice and survival of a nation? Amos seemed to think so.  \\nIt would be easy to dismiss such passages as evidence of Hebrew Scriptures’  - the Old Testament’s - preoccupation with harsh law, judgment and God’s wrath.  It is often assumed that in contrast, Christian scriptures in the New Testament are filled with love, compassion and God’s mercy.  Why read the Old Testament, as we call it.  For starters, the Hebrew scriptures were important to Jesus; he quoted them all the time.  In dismissing them, we may miss the reminder that God loves us enough to tell the truth about us and our behavior.  Throughout Jewish history, God’s judgment is always intricately linked to God’s compassion and mercy.  Perhaps the word “judgment” has become corrupted for us, because we have experienced the pain and exclusion that so often comes from human judgment.  We each have endured critical words, shaming expressions and rejecting behavior.  We have been wounded by human judgment.  And throughout Christian history, human assumptions and judgement have been projected onto God.  But there may be a clue about the outreach and in reach question, the save or savor dilemna, if we better understand God’s judgment of us.  God’s judgment is always about healing and new life. \\nWhat happened in Amos’ time is not unfamiliar to us.  We live in a prosperous nation where the gap between rich and poor continues to widen and the resources of adequate healthcare, education, jobs and housing become increasingly scarce for even hard-working people on the margins.  A board member of the food shelf recently told me they estimate that 10% of Cook County residents are “food insecure.”  Faced with these many needs, we can volunteer, do political advocacy and give our charitable donations, but we may still feel disconnected from God.  The author Corinne Ware writes in her book on the contemporary practice of ancient Benedictine spirituality: “Acts we do in obedience to our highest values are good things, and they enrich our lives and the lives of others.  Scripture says that such conduct ‘pleases God.’ That is not guarantee, however, that we will feel God’s presence with us, long term.  The ‘something more’ that we seek is that sense of always being accompanied, of God-with-us at all times and not special moments only.” (Corinne Ware, St. Benedict on the Freeway, p. 25).  The “something more” appears to come from the in-reach part, the savoring of life, which brings us to the Mary/Martha story. \\nThe Gospel author Luke, writing some 40-60 years after Jesus’s death, probably included this short vignette as an example of true discipleship.  He intends to guide his community of Christians on what is most important as they seek to follow the spirit of the living Christ in their midst.  In the telling, Luke compares two types of behavior; he lifts up two priorities for anyone who would seek to follow in the way of Jesus.   There is the active-seeming priority of doing service to others, as exemplified by Martha’s serving; the saving part.  There is the more passive-seeming priority of listening to and reflecting on Jesus teachings, as observed in Mary’s quiet listening at Jesus feet; the savoring part.   It’s a deceptively simple story that can easily serve as a put down of traditional women’s roles and of the person who always ends up in the kitchen.   Let’s see what was going on in this dinnertime drama.\\n\\tJesus arrives at Martha’s house for a visit and a meal.  Mary, Martha’s sister, immediately sits at Jesus’ feet, taking the position of a disciple, and quietly listens to his teaching.   Martha, the homeowner and host, is busy getting dinner ready for her honored friend and teacher.  And, she soon begins to sound frazzled.  Perhaps we can relate: Eager to make a big to-do in our hospitality efforts, focused on details behind the scene of an important family or church event, we sometimes can lose track of the real focus.  We become understandably resentful of those who just sit and chat, while others of us set-up and clean-up a church meal, mow the lawn, work hard in the meetings, carry the trash barrel to the street.  But food needs to get to the table so Jesus and his friends can eat!  \\n\\tBut as Luke tells it, Martha has become busy with “many tasks.”  The word “task” in Greek is “diakonein,” which is elsewhere in the New Testament the word used to describe Christian ministry or the role of deacon.   Apparently, Christian discipleship is about serving.  But here, the serving has become a problem and it has distracted Martha.  She gets exasperated, and we soon realize how off-centered she has become. One of the results is that she doesn’t confront her sister Mary directly, “oh Mary, I could use a little help here, please!”  She has taken on too much, and now resents her sister choice of listening to Jesus talk. Notice how Martha deals with her frustration.  She “triangles” someone else into the conflict.   Triangles happen all the time in families and in church communities and they are hard to avoid.  Instead of approaching Mary directly, Martha “triangles” Jesus: “Lord, do you not care that my sister has left me to do all the work by myself? Tell her then to help me,” Martha demands.   She doesn’t suggest to Mary that they both work to quickly get dinner on the table then they can all sit and listen to Jesus.    Maybe Martha wanted the table set just so, and the dishes prepared as only she could do it.  Whatever it was, her expectations and her anxiousness collide with the reality that only a simple meal is needed.  And she doesn’t face the conflict directly; she goes sideways with her anger.  \\n“Martha, Martha,” says Jesus.  We will never know the actual tone or the expression on Jesus’ face in this conversation.  Perhaps we can hear exasperation and even challenging judgment in his voice.   But I also hear compassion as Jesus calls her to new life. “Martha, you are worried and distracted by many things…few things are necessary, there is need of only one thing.”  Jesus alludes here to both a simple meal and a singular focus.  “Mary has chosen the better part, which will not be taken away from her.”  At this dinner hour, Jesus judges Martha and he challenges her.  He calls her back to her true self.  Not unlike Amos reminding the people of northern Israel of their covenant with God, their call to be a just society and a light to the nations.\\t\\nTo save or savor, to improve the world or to enjoy the world.  The choices will confront us daily, and one is not necessarily better or more holy than the other.  But living in the Kingdom of God calls for a singular focus, says Jesus.   “Few things are necessary” Jesus reminds us.  Sitting at Jesus’ feet, our daily prayer and soaking in the Word, keeps us from getting distracted as we make difficult daily decisions about our actions.  God’s merciful judgment will tell us the truth in love.  Thanks be to God.   Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\n\\nA CHANGE OF HEART\\n\\n\\tThese two Bible stories are admittedly startling: A man riding along blinded by a light then hearing voices and falling off his horse?  A supposidly dead Jesus BBQing fish on a beach, a bizarre multi-fish miracle, the disciple Peter putting on his clothes to jump in the water!  Did these events really happen? In a diverse congregation such as ours, we will have a range of opinions and beliefs about this.  I suggest we consider what the authors of the Book of Acts and the Gospel of John may have been trying to do by including these tales.   Which means we may have to drop our 21st century notion of “accurate reporting” and listen more imaginatively and deeply.  \\n\\tI suggest we start with this question that was addressed to the disciple Peter by Jesus:  “do you love me?” Have you ever been asked this question:  “Do you love Jesus?” There are a number of Christian communities where members greet each other regularly with personal questions about one’s relationship with Jesus: “how is your walk with Jesus going these days?”   Maybe you have experienced questions such as these as a litmus test, a way of ferreting out if you were really saved.  Do you love Jesus?  Does the question make us feel  uncomfortable, our personal space a bit invaded, leaving our mind a tad befuddled?  Ask yourself, “Do I love Jesus?”  Notice the thoughts and feelings that come up for you as we move into the stories.\\nTurning first to the Acts piece about Saul of Tarsus.  He will later be identified by his Roman name, Paul, and become a major spokesperson for the early church.  But Saul, a learned Jew and son of a Roman citizen, never met the historical Jesus.  In the years following Jesus’ death and reports of his resurrection, Saul grew to mistrust and even hate Jesus’ increasingly bold followers. Saul had joined forces with those teachers of the Law who believe that the followers of Jesus were misguided and were a liability for the whole Jewish community.   Especially considering the Jewish community’s tenuous relationship with the oppressive Roman authorities.\\nOne day, Saul is on the road to Damascus, heading off to interrogate and harass some more followers of Jesus Christ.  Saul is suddenly overwhelmed by  brilliant light and a voice: “Saul, Saul, why do you persecute me?”  His traveling companions can hear it too:  “I am Jesus, whom you are persecuting!”  Saul falls off his horse and is blinded by the encounter.  The voice tells them to go to Damascus and await further instructions.    There Saul is healed by one of the Jesus’ disciples, is baptized and begins to proclaim the Risen Jesus in the synagogues.  An astonishing turn-around, a drastic change of heart.  We might wonder: What converts such mistrust into affirmation?  What changes the actions of hate into love?\\n\\tPerhaps there has been a time when this has happened in your own life.  A time when clinging to old perceptions and feelings, problematic and settled ways of seeing and doing things, just did not work anymore?  Yesterday I was reading stories about the short but impactful lay ministry of a young woman named Rachel Held Evans.  Columnist, best selling author and popular speaker, she courageously called out homophobia, judgemental Biblical literalism and misogyny in the church.  She was invited by President Obama to serve on a White House\\xa0council\\xa0for faith-based and neighborhood partnerships.  All because she had experienced her own “thrown to the ground” moment. Her conservative church’s participation in a statewide campaign to ban same-sex marriage led her to change her views on homosexuality and transgender issues. She went on to challenge both conservative and progressive evangelicals to a change of heart. As a straight woman, married with young children, she became an unusual ally for the LGBTQ+ community and fighting misogyny in evangelical circles.  Eventually drawn to the richness of the liturgy and social justice focus, she joined an Episcopal church. With tremendous appeal to a wide audience of younger spiritual seekers, she continued to publish, blog and speak about her love for church, Jesus and the Bible. \\nThe softening of a heart can happen slowly over time; or we get radically confronted, throw to the ground like Saul, “carved-out” by some event: by a disappointment, a failure, a loss….for Rachel Held Evans it was her church working against the marriage equality act and the exclusion of women’s leadership in her evangelical circles.  What might it be for each of us?  What old certitudes, ingrained habits, no longer serve your well-being? \\nWhen we find Peter with a group of the other disciples by the Sea of Tiberias in today’s passage from John, its hard to see that their hearts have changed in any significant way.  I can just imagine Peter turning dejectedly to his companions: “Jesus is gone.  So much for us being ‘fishers of men and women.’  I’m going back to fishing for fish.”  They put out their boat and labor all night.  But no fish.  \\nThese men, among others, have already encountered the Risen Jesus, talked with him, had the Holy Spirit breathed on them, been commissioned to go out and forgive in Jesus name.   But here, they don’t even recognize the stranger who calls out from the beach, saying: “hey, let your nets down on the other side of your boat.”  They start to strain against the huge load of fish in their nets.  Abundance, overwhelming fish abundance, slithering out onto the deck.  “I have come that you might have abundant life,” Jesus used to tell them. And suddenly a switch flips in Peter; it’s like a light goes on, he’s thrown to the bottom of his assumptions that it is all over and he shouts, “It is the Lord!”  He flings himself into the water, thrashing towards Jesus on the shore.  \\nBefuddled, the rest of the disciples do not understand until they actually have eaten breakfast together with this stranger on the beach.  Each of the disciples have been “thrown down” from their assumptions that this “inclusive, merciful, abundant, present Kingdom of God” Jesus taught was all over.  “Well, we figured we would just go back to fishing for fish,” they try to explain.  Jesus gazes at them with such tenderness, such compassion.  And then, the question: “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks.   \\n“What?  Why, yes, Lord; you know that I love you,” Peter answers, perhaps remembering the first time he denied even knowing Jesus during those terrifying hours following Jesus’ arrest.  “Ah…well then feed my lambs,” says Jesus.   “Feed your lambs…?” Peter scratches his head.  “Peter, do you love me?”  Jesus asks again.  “Well, yeah, you know I love you!”  Peter mumbles, remembering how he lied to that woman in the Temple courtyard that awful day.  \\n“Tend my sheep,” replies Jesus.   All the disciples are staring at the two of them; what is going on here?   But now Jesus is asking Peter again;  “Do you love me?”  And the light of comprehension starts dawning even brighter.   Peter finally sinks deep into the reality of his own forgiven self.  It’s as though Jesus is saying: “I am seeing you Peter, for all that you have been and all that you are. Can you open to that”  Peter, do you love me?”  \\nAnd it all comes crashing in for Peter.  “Lord, you know everything;” he cries.  “You know how I abandoned not only you, but how I abandoned that best self I came to be as your disciple.  You know it all, and you still want me to go out in your name and fish for people and forgive and tend and feed all those who hunger for you.  You know that I love you.”  \\n\\tMaybe this is what a change of heart, conversion, really looks like.  It isn’t suddenly having an intellectual certainty about a creed or belief or theological concept.  For whatever reason, in that dawning awareness, there is an opening of our hearts to seeing ourselves and reality differently.  In her latest and what would be her final book,\\xa0,  Rachel Held Evans wrote this about Christian community: “Church is not a building, or a denomination, or a nonprofit organization. Church is a moment in time when the kingdom of God draws near, when a meal, a story, a song, an apology, and even a failure is made holy by the presence of Jesus among us and within us.”\\xa0 Having just keynoted at the “Why Christian?” conference in San Francisco several weeks ago, Rachel Held Evans became ill and was hospitalized.  She had adverse reactions to medication and died yesterday morning.   Who knows how much time we each have for a change of heart? \\nAffirming our love for Jesus will always send us out, like it did Saul and Peter and, centuries later, Rachel Held Evans.   “Follow me,” Jesus says at the end of the beach encounter.  We are invited to follow him. Not just as dead hero and teacher, but as a living presence leading us deeper into God’s hurting world. To forgive and to feed and to tend.   I thank God for that.  Amen. (Time of Silent Reflection)',\n",
       " 'April 8, 2018\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tSecond Sunday in Easter – Year B\\nFirst Congregational Church, UCC\\tJohn 20:19-23\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\tActs 4:32-35\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nPASSING ON GOD’S PEACE\\n\\n\\tTwo scripture readings today, both from the New Testament.  Biblical texts which describe the early followers of Jesus in curiously different ways.  In one, from the Gospel of John, the disciples of Jesus have retreated into hiding right after his death.  The rest of his followers have apparently melted away into the shadows of Jerusalem, fearing reprisals by the Roman authorities.  In the passage from the Book of Acts, set a few months later, chapter 4 describes several disciples bolding teaching in public in the large metropolis, and “proclaiming that in Jesus there is resurrection from the dead.”  Over the days that follow, thousands are said to join their movement, becoming known as People of the Way.  They live in communities of radical welcome where rich and poor, slave and free, male and female, are mutually embraced and where they hold everything that they own in common.  That’s a pretty big jump, from hiding in fear, to publicly proclaiming Jesus’ message of loving community and generosity!  \\n\\n\\tFor some people, the debate about Easter centers on the whether or not Jesus was actually physically resurrected.  But for me, I’m more intrigued by these followers of Jesus: what in the world happened to those terrified, guilt-ridden disciples?  How did they move from their deep sadness about his death and shame about betraying their beloved teacher, not to mention their own fear about arrest by the Romans?  This is what I want to know about, because in my own life and ministry I am deeply interested about how people can change.  How can I change my own attitudes and habits that just don’t serve God’s intentions for my life?  How can communities change their cultures of negative interactions, become more respectful, and support of a common vision of radical welcome and generosity?  When it comes to being a 21st century follower of the Way of Jesus, I want to know about the change stuff…..about how we become transformed into being agents of God’s love, instruments of peace and justice.   \\n\\n\\tThe Gospel of John passage returns us to the night after the morning that several of Jesus’ women followers discovered the empty tomb.  It’s Easter night.  Jesus had just been publically humiliated and executed as a troublesome teacher and prophet. The Jewish leaders were understandably trying to maintain a fragile peace with the occupying Roman legions, especially during this festival time of Passover when the population of Jerusalem would swell with pilgrims coming to the great Temple.  Jesus’ magnetic presence and compelling teachings had already gathered crowds elsewhere and created public disturbances. His proclamations on equality and compassion, just distribution of wealth and his acts of civil disobedience were troubling to those in power.  The religious leaders decided Jesus needed to be stopped for the good of the whole and dragged him before the Roman executioners.  Following the harrowing torture and crucifixion scene, Jesus’ disciples were terrified that the authorities would come after them too, as they had been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.\\n\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what is going on in the disciples’ minds as they huddle together in this darkened room.  Are they planning to slip out of Jerusalem and return to their fishing businesses and family life? But those troublesome women disciples have not been hiding. They went to Jesus’ tomb early that morning, and now they keep insisting Jesus is alive. \\n\\n\\tAll of a sudden, in the midst of anxious conversation behind locked doors, Jesus appears in front of them.   “Peace be with you,” he announces.  It is hard for us to imagine what it would feel like to see your murdered teacher and leader standing before you.  Actually, the disciples don’t recognize him at first.  He’s not a ghost, but not quite recognizably human either.  As post-Enlightenment people, strong on physical evidence and verification, this kind of stuff makes us antsy.  The thought of encountering anything related to the “spirit” world immediately kicks up visions of hauntings, zombies or New Age flakiness.  In response to the confusion and fear on the disciples’ faces, Jesus says to the group: “peace be with you.”  He then shows them his crucifixion wounds on his hands and side.  I’ll bet these disciples were hoping to never run into Jesus again, given their complicity in his death.  It wasn’t just Judas who betrayed Jesus.   Jesus’ close friend Peter denied knowing him 3x and most of the rest of them ran and hid after Jesus was arrested.  What might they expect Jesus to say now?  “Thanks a lot, you guys.  Way to be there for your friend.”   But no, Jesus says simply “peace be with you.”  No condemnation here.  Only affirmation and blessing.  The odd thing is that Jesus appears to trust that these frightened, cowardly people will become messengers of transformation themselves.  He immediately commissions them: “As God sent me, so I send you.”  No cozy hanging around in a privatized spiritual world with sweet Jesus, enjoying the peaceful vibes.  Jesus breathes on them saying, “receive the Holy Spirit.”  You are not in this alone.  He charges them:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”   Get up, you all, Jesus tells them.  You are blessed, you are forgiven, I need you to go out into the world and do some healing forgiveness work in my name!\\n\\n\\tAnd it all starts with: “peace be with you.”  I am reminded of how we are invited to “pass the peace” in worship each Sunday. The words sometimes seem awkward and It’s easy to lapse into a “hi, how are you?’” kind of salutation during this time.  Folks end up chatting about church business or baseball scores or after-worship lunch plans.  I invite us to reconsider these words of Jesus: “peace be with you.”  What are we trying to accomplish in those moments of greeting?  Or, what might we be extending to one another if we were to look each other directly in the eye and say these words: “peace be with you” - ?   \\n\\tTo extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of Christ, is no casual thing.  This is not just “being friendly.”  “Peace be with you” one person says; and “and also with you” the receiver may respond.  There is an old-fashion formality to it.  I don’t mean to suggest we should greet each other on Sundays with only these four words.   But these words themselves are a gift we give each other.   What am I hoping for, when I extend the peace of the Risen Jesus, the peace of God, to another person?  It may be a simple way of saying: there you are, I welcome you into this radically embracing community, and I trust your good intentions. Jesus challenged his disciples to forgive others and their sins would be forgiven; he warned them that if they held onto the sins of any, with resentment and bitterness, they would be retained. Relationships would stay broken.  Could there be some connection here between extending peace and acknowledging forgiveness?   How might we live into this challenge more fully as individuals and as a congregation?\\n\\n\\tThe Book of Acts describes that the early followers of the Risen Jesus were known for their being of “one heart and soul.”  Their’s was an unusually  close community that broke down all kind of social and class barriers.  They were known for their sharing everything.  “Everything they owned was held in common” and “there was not a needy person among them.”  The early Christian communities quickly gained a reputation for some fairly radical lifestyle choices in the Middle Eastern world of first century Roman occupation. (Dan Clendenin, a contemporary Biblical scholar, writes on his web-blog “Journey with Jesus” that) The characteristics of loving community and incredible generosity appear to account for the huge number of converts in 1st century Jerusalem.  People wanted to join this “emergent Jesus-community” because it was so different from the rest of their culture that valued military might, the acquisition of wealth and prestige.   \\n\\n\\tIt occurs to me that this is the standard for Christian community to which every church is held:  Are we different from the rest of our predominant culture that values individual freedom, competition, power and material goods above all else?   “Peace be with you,” we say to one another.  Perhaps that is where we start.  It’s an invitation to transformation we extend to each other during worship.  Because don’t really know, on any given Sunday, what a person brings with them to worship.  We don’t really know the full extent of the worries or fears, the sadness or anxiety that lie on the hearts of our fellow worshippers.  Each of us, at one time or another, comes to worship “locked” in something, just like the disciples who were locked behind closed doors.   “Peace be with you,” we say to stranger and close friend alike.  “A Community and generosity is here for you, as it is for me,” we signal one another.  \\n\\n\\tWe gather in communal worship because we want a transformative experience of the living God, among other people.  What a gracious and hopeful thing to say to one another in our worship time:  “peace be with you.”  Simple words, but they are Jesus’ words.  “Peace be with you” Jesus repeated a second time to the startled disciples.  “As God has sent me, so I send you.”  Apparently this is how change starts to happen.  God’s transformative peace is offered to us; and so we are sent.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\nNotes:  \\n\\tThe “generosity and community” reference describing the early Christian community, as reported in the Book of Acts, comes from Dan McClendenin (Journey with Jesus website).\\n\\tThe writings of Rowan Williams, former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, have influenced my understanding of the disciples’ reactions to Jesus’ post-resurrection appearances (Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel).  \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nA PLUMB LINE OF COMPASSION\\n\\n\\n\\tMany years ago, I was walking to a church meeting in downtown San Francisco.  I was in my late 20’s, a newly ordained minister, serving as an Associate Pastor in a suburban church south of the city.  I was headed to a meeting in the Northern California Conference offices of the United Church of Christ.   After parking my car in a city lot, I wended my way through a run-down part of the city called “south of Market Street.”  There were lots of street people panhandling, numerous unsavory-seeming characters hanging out on front stoops, but I don’t remember feeling too fazed.  Until…until I walked by a weather-beaten and disheveled man who was lying in an alleyway. He looked inebriated…or comotose…or even dead.  I felt worried and uncertain.  I paused, confused and embarrassed;  should I try to help him?  I might look stupid if I reach down to help him and he refuses, or he might strike out at me.  What to do?  Befuddled, I looked away and kept on walking.  I attended my meeting.  On my way back to the parking lot, several hours later, I glanced into the alley to see if the man was still there.  He was gone.  I will never know if he was helped by someone, if he was in the city morgue, or if he got up and walked away under his own steam.  The vision of him lying on the ground haunts me to this day.  \\n\\tPerhaps you remember a person who needed your help at some point. Maybe you can recall how, for some reason or another, you looked away….you didn’t reach out.  Perhaps like many American Christians, you read the newspaper or email feeds, and listen to the radio and watch the television news and have the same conversation with yourself.  “Oh gracious, look at this story, look at those awful photos, look at those people….how can the world have so many tragic things happening? What can I do about this?” you ask yourself.  We might find ourselves wondering how much of all this we really are responsible for, but most often there it ends.  Something distracts us, or we just turn away feeling confused and powerless, sad, even despairing.  At times like this, I am left wondering what God really might want me to do.\\nToday’s texts invite us to consider the responsibility we feel, or do not feel, towards fellow human beings.  In our scripture passage from Luke, a lawyer, an expert in the Jewish law, approaches Jesus and asks:  “What must I do to inherit eternal life?”    One’s religious “inheritance” was common language in Hebrew scriptures and referred to the blessings of being part of God’s covenant, living in God’s Kingdom.  For 1st century Jews living under the heel of Roman occupation and harassment, this whole “inheritance” of living God’s Kingdom seems to have vanished. The man’s question is not about the afterlife; it’s about how this Kingdom might be made real on earth and how he himself could be a part of it, in the middle of what seemed like Jewish disinheritance.  Jesus replies as any good Jew would, reminding his questioner that the essence of the Law is love; love of God and love of neighbor.   \\nIt is precisely a lack of love of God and neighbor that the Jewish prophet Amos was criticizing, some 900 years before this encounter.  Speaking truth to the powerful northern Kingdom of Israel, Amos sharply condemns the materialism and corruption of the reigning house of Jeroboam.  Court officials are corrupt and unjust.  The wealthy luxuriate while the poor wither and God notices.  Amos has a vision of God “measuring” Israel’s leaders with a plumb line, and basically finding them out-of-wack.  Seriously lacking in justice and compassion.  There will be consequences, says Amos, and sure enough the Assyrians soon overrun the weakened regime.\\nThe Jewish scholar questioning Jesus many years later would know these writings in Amos.   He would already know that love and compassionate action towards those in need was the bottom line in the Jewish Torah.  But he pushes further:  “But Jesus, just who is my neighbor?”  And this question strikes at the core of all of our good intentions as helpful people:  Who exactly is my neighbor?  Who are we supposed to be helping? What are the limits of our duty to those in need?  When have we done enough, as individuals, as a church, as a nation?   \\n\\tIt’s at this point that Jesus tells the story of a man traveling alone down the steep path between high cliffs, on his way from Jerusalem to Jericho.  Rugged, bleak terrain and a dangerous route, known for thieves who would hide in the caves in the cliffs.   Traveler were often beaten, robbed and left for dead.  A Temple priest and then a Levite, a lay associate who helped in the Jerusalem Temple, both hurry by and ignore the man in distress.  But Jesus has complicated the story.  These are not necessarily heartless, pompous religious leaders.  If either of them had stopped, and actually touched what may have been a corpse, they would then be ritually impure and unable to fulfill their obligations of leadership in the Temple.  Given their duties, the these two men are portrayed as prudent, carefully responsible to their leadership roles.  Hmmm….not unlike a young pastor hurrying to her meeting in San Francisco!   \\nJesus would now have everyone’s attention. In story-teller tradition, characters or actions are often presented in groups of three. The third piece carries the change-up, the twist in the story that will catch the hearers off-guard. Jesus concludes the story by saying that it is a third person, a Samaritan, who finally stops, attends to and carries the wounded traveler to help.   But here’s the puzzle: a Samaritan would be the least likely person to help a Jew. Jews and Samaritan’s at this time were about as friendly as Irish Catholics and Protestants have been in the recent past, or Palestinians and Iraelis today.   Samaritans were descendents of the people left by Assyria after it had invaded and exiled the northern kingdom of Israel.  The Samaritans were observers of the Torah and Jewish feast and holy days, spoke the same language and worshipped the same God as the Jews, but they had intermarried with foreigners.  Samaritans were therefore considered unclean, ritually impure.  The “unwanted, rejected” person in the story, the Samaritan, “shows mercy to his enemy,” a Jew (Hawkins).  \\n\\tFor this Samaritan, there was no real distinction between clean and unclean, between Samaritan and Jew.  Perhaps Jesus is reminding his listeners that there is an essential unity to all life, and there just isn’t a line between “your well-being and my well-being.”  (Bruce Epperly, Lancaster Seminary, Process and Faith website, 7.15.07).   I think about how the well-being of our nation may be connected to how we welcome needy strangers into our collective midst.  Our nation has a long and ugly history of rejecting certain immigrants.  Our rejection of Jewish refugees trying to flee Nazi terror caused countless unnecessary deaths.  A recent editorial in the New York Times noted we vascilate between “folly and cruelty on immigration.”  (7.7.19, p.9 , Ross Douthat, “Week in Review”).  Current legislative proposals swing from wildly impractical to stunningly inhumane.  And now, talk of sending people to a safe, third country?  The current suggestion is Guatemala, where deep “poverty, entrenched political corruption, urban crime,” is rampant (NYTimes, 714.19).  How do we better frame this debate?  According to Jesus, refugees’ well-being and our well-being is interconnected.  The prophet Amos described God as being outraged by the injustice of the northern kingdom of Israel some 3000 years ago.  Might God be offended by our current care of migrant children at the southern border and our splitting up of desperate families?  \\nAfter completing the parable, Jesus asks the lawyer, “which of these three do you think was a neighbor to the man who fell into the hands of robbers?” (vs. 36).  The legal scholar can’t even say the word Samaritan, and he simply replies  “the one who showed him mercy.” (vs. 37).  “Go and do likewise,” replies Jesus.   \\nHow might we each “go and do likewise” this week?  Who needs our help as a congregation?  How might we be better informed about those who are in need at our borders?  How do we become advocates for more compassionate and just immigration policies as a Just Peace church?  Stay alert, pay attention, says Jesus; look for the unlikely places where we are called to compassion.  Amen.  \\n\\t ',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n \\n\\nGOD’S PECULIAR BLESSINGS\\n\\tWell, it’s been another one of those weeks in for us as a nation.  Once again, I find myself struggling with the news in one hand and the Biblical text in the other.  The impeachment trial grinds on, now without the benefit of witnesses.   Exclusion of testimony and evidence.   Our nation is now banning entry of people from 6 more predominately Muslim countries.  In addition to African countries of Eritrea, Sudan and Tanzania, this Presidential order will virtually exlude immigration from Africa’s most populous nation, Nigeria, and from Myanmar, where the Muslim minority is fleeing genocide.  That makes 13 countries on the list.  Exclusion and more exclusion.  What an irony that today is the Sunday we lift up inclusion, inclusivity, as one of our core values we share as a congregation.   What might today’s texts, one from a 8th century minor prophet named Micah, and the other from the 1st century Common Era record of the teachings of Jesus, have to say to us, in this time and place?\\n\\tThe Micah text may be actually easier to relate to:  the prophet channels God’s frustration with the people of Jerusalem.  They are experiencing a time of prosperity and revival of their nation, but in the process are ignoring the poor and marginalized among them.  “Stop it already, with your elaborate sacrifices and pompous ceremonies,” says God.  “All I ask of you, I’ve already told you this, is that you do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with me as my partner.  Do the stuff that restores community, not fracture and corrupt it”.  \\n\\tJesus, however, begins his public ministry in an unsettled and precarious time for the Jewish people during the early first century.  They were living in occupied land, dominated by the repressive Roman regime and have little control over their communal lives.  The central religious question for Judaism at the time was: how do we do justice, love kindness and walk humbly with God, now in the midst of our enemies? \\n\\tNow Jesus shows up and is addressing the same issue of “how shall we live in this mess without going crazy” but in a new way:  he starts talking about being an alternative community in the present situation, but not by fighting it with violence or completely withdrawing from it.  Be an alternative community here, in light of the future reign, the empire of God….which was at hand!  Which was is within you!  What? (Feasting on the Word commentary, Fourth Sunday in Epiphany, Year A). This was a paradoxical message that both confused and challenged people.   To illustrate how to do this, he talked about how to live in this world of repression, competition and fear.  By recognizing God’s blessings.  Which, if we consider Matthew’s report, sound really strange.  \\nIn our contemporary world, we tend to associate God’s blessings with worldly goods and financial gain, with unexpected rescues from danger or reprieves from illness or catastrophe.  This is the message of the Prosperity Gospel which has gotten increasingly popular of late.  And there is a thread of this thinking laced through the Bible. Law abiding and righteousness would be rewarded by God, with wealth and well-being.  It’s part of our Protestant work ethic: if you work hard, you will be rewarded with abundance.  When we see others faced with poverty, with difficulties or disasters, we may even assume it is their fault. We tend to ignore the restrictions of systemic racism and classism, and figure people are just lazy if they are unemployed or unsuccessful.  If difficulties happen to us, we may start wondering if God has abandoned us, or is even punishing us.  But the teachings from Jesus’ Sermon on the Mount seem to challenge this view of blessings of health and abundance as reward.  Let’s listen it again:  “Blessed are the poor, blessed are the meek, blessed are those who are reviled and persecuted, blessed are those who hunger and thirst…” How odd this sounds to us.\\nPart of the problem here is that it is hard for us to describe just what God is up to in our lives.  I know of a pastor who tried asking members his congregation to describe what God was up to in their lives.  He reports they stared back at him blankly.  He tried a different question: “well, what’s been keeping you awake at night?”  And one by one, the stories poured out.   It’s difficult, isn’t it, to talk about what God is up to in our lives.  We don’t want to sound overly pious, or even presumptuous.  But most of us can describe what keeps us up at night.  I think of those as “unblessings” – it’s easy to talk about those!\\nIn today’s passage, Jesus says all kinds of people are blessed who seemed particularly “unblessed” in their culture.  He claims that God is up to something in their lives:  Poor people, disempowered people, the grieving, the people working for peace, the persecuted.  Jesus is not suggesting that God caused these unfortunate circumstances.  No…simply that when we feel “unblessed” we may want to ponder what God is doing in us, in the midst of the mess.  \\nSimilar to the ancient world, we live in a predominant culture that values wealth, status, security and power.  Nationally, we have an aversion to foreign people who don’t seem very “blessed” with these things.  People who are poor, who are persecuted, who are fleeing trauma.  Jesus would say that they have a special connection with the kingdom of God, with inheriting the earth, with being filled and comforted.  But somehow, we see them as our enemies who must be excluded. \\nHere’s Jesus approach to relating to those we do not want to include: He lists the kinds of people who were being drawn to him, who knew their emptiness and their need for God, who could taste their search for meaning, who longed for healing and hope.  Over and over in the Biblical tradition, the care for people in these people was a sign of God’s realm breaking in.  We get to be part of this “breaking in” as we do justice, love kindness and walk humbly as God’s partners.\\n\\tBut what is the inner work that we have to do to make these actions happen with wisdom and consistency?  For starters, we can ponder the unblessings in our lives. How can these things that keep us awake, that tug at our attention and worry us, be the places where we are blessed?  As odd as this sounds, I am beginning to think that there are some possibilities here.  Because if I am honest, I have to admit that I seldom have trouble sleeping when I am feeling happy and peaceful about things.  I also seem to talk less with God during these contented times.  I’m running the show of my life and doing it well! Things that keep me awake at night are often connected to worries of screwing up the show: impending loss or lack of abundance, of being mis-understood or even rejected.  Our perceived “unblessings” often make us want to protect ourselves, to push people away, to form exlusive rules and place bans.  But could these challenges be places of God’s peculiar blessing? Where I have to face that my ego’s “safety and happiness plan” is not always helpful? Where I am thrown back on my dependence on God?  Could these be the worrisome conditions that actually help us grow, help us develop empathy with those who are struggling even more mightily than we are? \\n\\tThis week, notice a place in your life this week that seems “unblessed.”  Might this be a place where God is working in you, in that difficulty? God is nudging each us, challenging our assumptions and fears, softening and opening our hearts, pushing us forward.  May we continue to ponder God’s peculiar blessings in our lives.  Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nJESUS AS GIVER OF NEW LIFE\\n\\n\\tAs we dive into the Hebrew Text, our Christian Old Testament, it’s important to remember these are Jesus’ scriptures, heard from his youth in the local synagogue and in the Jerusalem temple.  They were the foundational texts that root all his teachings.   In the first 11 chapters of Genesis, he would have gained a panoramic perspective of the whole of God’s creation on earth.  Everything from the complex and controversial creation myths to the Garden of Eden, to Cain killing his brother Abel.  And then, basically mayhem all over the planet, as humans make of God’s creation.  Jesus might have wondered about God’s ultimate clean-up strategy in sending the flood.  And how God pretty much gave up on dealing with these creative but violent beings who kept abusing the gift of free will. \\n\\tThe narrative then focuses on the descendants of Shem, one of Noah’s sons.  The Biblical writers would want us to know that God is on to a new strategy of mending this broken universe God has created.  God focuses in on one group of people, rather randomly it would seem, to do a bold new thing. Against a background of broken, divided and violent humanity, God will bless this man and his wife, their descents, and make of them a great nation.  Why?  These folks are not particularly special or God.  God is simply deeply invested in this human enterprise.  God now invites a particular people to be a blessing to the rest of the world through the way that they will live.  Jesus would hear this as his family history.\\n\\tGod invites Abram and his descendents into co-creatorship; to engage in a communal ethic that would promote justice and mercy as an example and blessing to the world.  But only, and here is the catch, only if Abram is willing to take a risk: to leave the ties of kinship in his nomadic community that assured his identity, economic well-being and physical security.  God says to Abram: You are going to need to trust me.  I’m not going to be specific about where you and your immediate family are headed. Leave your securities and I will show you, on a need to know basis.  You are going to have to take a risk here.   New life entails risk.  As Jesus grew older, I wonder what risks he contemplated?\\nWhich makes me wonder….What risks are you and I willing to take these days, when we sense a call to new life?  Especially collectively, in an era where we are being told our identity, our economic well-being, our physical security and now our own health depends on pulling in, building walls, hunkering down?  \\n\\tFast forward thousands of years to what will become this couples’ descendents: Jews of all different perspectives and practices, living under Roman rule in and around Jerusalem in the early first century CE.  Jesus and his people have come a long way as a nation, times of peace and prosperity, enduring foreign domination, exile, return to rebuild…..and now the repressive Roman occupation.  The insidious presence of an imperial culture that demanded taxes, military conscription, and appalingly, worship of their Emperor Augustus.  \\n\\tThe Pharisees of the day were the legal scholars who helped people interpret the Jewish Torah, the law, for the present day situation that was full of risks.  The Pharisees approach to living among the Roman enemy was mostly a “quietly resist in place” strategy.  One was to carefully follow the guidance of the law, in hopes that this collective righteousness would provide fertile ground for the return of God’s righteous reign on earth.  \\n\\tBy the time of this particular night-time encounter, Jesus and his disciples had arrived in Jerusalem for the Jewish Passover. They will soon run into trouble with the local authorities. The Pharisee Nicodemus was a member of the Council of the Sanhedrin, the official Jewish court made up of seventy scribes, priests and elders.  Clearly a respected and important community leader.  But why was he sneaking around town in the dark?  Was he worried what his Jerusalem colleagues would think if he talked with Jesus?  Many of the Pharisees were increasingly concerned that Jesus’ teachings and rabble rousing would bring down the wrath of the Romans on the whole Jewish community.  But there was also an ancient tradition that the Torah, the written Law, was actually best studied at night, when all was quiet and you could really focus on the complexities and marvel of the text.  Nichodemus takes a risk, and comes to “study” Jesus in the still of the night. \\n\\tIn our imagination, we see Jesus answer the quiet knock at the door.  They sit together in the dim light.  Nicodemus respectfully addresses him as “rabbi,” revered teacher.   We hear the caution in Nicodemus’ words; he politely acknowledges Jesus is from God, (not divine, from God) because of the miracles Jesus has performed.  But Jesus seems to ignore Nicodemus’ careful opening words and replies curtly:  “No one can see the kingdom of God without being born from above.”  “Excuse me? What?” Nicodemus may well have responded.  Born from above, also translated as “born again or anew.”\\n\\tThis language of being born again, has been incredibly divisive in the Christian church.  Same with the following verse about believing so you can have eternal life.  These few passages have made for a lot of stereotypes and bad press about purportedly exclusive Christian claims.  I am talking about the assumption that you are either in or you are out, depending on what you believe.  This has had disastrous historical consequences, of course, as anyone considered out has, at various times in church history, been shamed, excluded, persecuted and/or killed.  \\n\\tBut notice that Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God, like it is a locality, or, as many assume, a place we might arrive after we die.  He talks about “seeing,” or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, reign of justice and compassion among us.  Jesus speaks as if it is already here, all around and even within us.  Our problem seems to be with a deeper perception of the eyes of the heart.  “No one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew” replies Jesus in an intentionally ambiguous response. It’s as if he says to Nicodemus, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  Great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us!   Logic and linear thinking solve many problems in life, but are little help in discovering God’s mystery and purpose in our lives.  How wrap our minds around all this?\\nCan we risk perceiving in a different way? \\nPerhaps the Kingdom of God is a place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Perhaps he is describing a transformed awareness that “doesn’t make separations between God and humans” between Muslims and Christians, between Republicans and Democrats. It’s as though Jesus is inviting Nicodemus to step into another dimension that is already there, welcoming him. (The contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault  Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind.  p. 30.) \\n Nicodemus can’t see or imagine himself being born again or anew or from above. That process looks too unknown, too problematic, too risky. He gets stuck in a literal interpretation.  He can’t grasp that Jesus is talking about a transformative experience of the living God through knowing, trusting and saying “YES” to the Jesus in front of him.  \\t\\n\\t“For God so loved the world, the cosmos, that God gave God’s only Son, so that everyone who believes the Son may not perish but may have everlasting life,” Jesus continues.  What was he really saying here?  “Your theological concepts need to be correct?” The Greek work\\xa0credo,\\xa0\"I believe,\" is more accurately translated as \"I give my heart to\" or \"I trust in.\" \\xa0What is Jesus asking Nicodemus to give his heart to, to trust in? \\xa0A ticket to heaven?   But “eternal life” is always connected to Jesus’ promise that he has come to bring “life, and life abundantly” in the present.  It’s all about a deeper living, a fuller connection with God in this moment, a wider sense of relationship with and responsibility for other humans and creation.\\t\\t\\n\\tWe are not exactly sure what happened to Nicodemus as he left Jesus that night.  But something must have started to work in Nicodemus, something began to “re-wire” inside of him and he perceived something anew.  Because later, when the chief priests and Pharisees want to have Jesus arrested, Nicodemus takes the personal risk of insisting that Jesus have a hearing before them first.   And perhaps most significant, it will be Nicodemus who joins Joseph of Arimathea to remove Jesus body from the cross after he is executed.   As the crowds disperse on that sad and awful late Good Friday afternoon, Nicodemus will bring over 100 pounds of spices with which to prepare Jesus’ body for burial.\\t\\n\\tWe don’t just want theological information; we yearn for a way in, to perceive God’s reign among us in a way that helps us be reborn and made new, again and again.  Only this perception shift will help us take the risks of renewing trust as a congregation, to risk of choosing and working with new clergy leadership.  Jesus waits for us in the quiet shadows of our hearts, ready to listen and to guide us.  May we meet him there.   Amen.\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tEzekial 37:1-14\\n\\n\\nJESUS AS A SOURCE OF NEW LIFE\\n\\nWe have two important but rather bewildering scripture stories presented at length today.  I’m hoping you will read both of them at some point, but I’ll offer a brief synopisis in my message rather than reading them right now.\\n\\tStory #1 – from the Hebrew scriptures – Ezekial 37:1-14 describes a wild dream the prophet Ezekial has one night.  He lives hundreds of years before Jesus, in a time when the nation of Israel was overrun and much of the Jewish population was taken into exile in Babylon.  Their temple in Jerusalem destroyed – great uncertainty - how would their sacred buildings, their culture, their lives ever be rebuilt?  Ezekial sees a vision of a valley of dry bones, that slowly start to rattle, then gain new tissue and skin and finally stand.   And God says to Ezekial, you go tell your people:  “I will bring you up out of your graves…put my spirit, my breath, within you and you shall live.” \\n\\tStory #2 is from the New Testament, and it too is a startling story!  It follows this same theme of death to new life.  And this is where I will focus my message, John chapter 11:1-45:  \\n\\tIn this passage, John describes Jesus’ final miracle or sign as occurring within a few miles of the huge metropolis of Jerusalem. A confusing scene unfolds before us:  close friends of Jesus urgently ask for his help.  When Jesus hears the news that Lazarus has sick he says “This illness does not lead to death; rather it is for God’s glory, so that the Son of God may be glorified through it.”  Wow.  Tell that to his frantic, grieving sisters.  Is this a twisted version of the simplistic and hurtful platitude: God is going to use your suffering for a greater good” - ?   I, for one, am not willing to embrace a notion of such a cruelly manipulative God.  But Jesus oddly focuses elsewhere for two days and his friend Lazarus dies.  Jesus weeps at this news.  There are angry accusations from Jesus’ close women friends, Mary and Martha, sisters of the dead man.  The Gospel writer includes theological proclamations about his being the Messiah and Son of God, there is more intense anguish and grief, and finally a dramatic act of healing.  First Lazarus is dead; then Lazarus is resusitated.   \\n\\tIn the middle of our current pandemic, we might simply dismiss this story, ……especially when it is lifted up as a tale with a happy ending.  See!  This Jesus is really amazing!  He must be divine – he brings the dead back to life!  And Jesus does that for us too!  Just believe!   We might toss the story off as another fanciful tale, in part because we are fact-focused post-Enlightenment people, who live in a world of measureable evidence and verifiable fact.  A dead person is made alive again.  Right.  \\n\\tI can sense that temptation to cynicism and avoidance when it comes to this story within myself.  I am reminded of how these attitudes can sometimes stifle my energy and my openness to new information from God.  A cynical hopelessness can creep up on me, especially when I’m feeling despairing, as I’m sure Mary and Martha were.  The enormity of the healing work and economic devastation in front of us in the midst of COVID-19 pandemic can leave us feeling scattered and de-energized.  Cynicism and avoidance can bring numbing quiet to the tumult in my head and heart.  But a larger part of me does not want to stay there.  I want to believe that in the midst of uncertainty, a new future, a new life, is emerging, being born among us.  But how? \\nJesus was one of many voices calling for reform and economic justice, in a time when religious and wealthy lay leaders were drawing benefits from living under the imperial domination system of the Romans.  Jesus knows that Jewish peasants who previously made a living off their land, growing their own fruits, grains and vegetables, now are now forced to grow luxury crops of figs, dates and olives for export.  The products are heavily taxed, and don’t feed their families; the profits benefit the wealthy.  Others are forced off their ancestral lands.  His criticism of those complicit Jewish leaders is biting. He is already spreading a message that some forms of communal interaction and governance must die, so something else can be resurrected and live.  And ironically, heading towards Jerusalem is leading him to his own death.  When Jesus arrives at Lazarus, Martha and Mary’s house, it’s not surprising he used this language: I am the resurrection and the life.  But what does this mean?\\n\\tArcheologists and historians have recently discovered that the town of Bethany, just a few miles outside of Jerusalem, was some kind of site for the care of the sick.  There seems to have been some kind of poor house for the destitute, a leper colony and a hospice for the dying. (wiki)  So, in addition to poverty, people in this region lived with and knew suffering deeply. I do know that it has been among such suffering communities that I have at times found the most hopefulness, and ironically, the most new life.   I have encountered people who were dying, who seemed radiant with love, with forgiveness, hopefulness, with life at its fullest.   We hear miraculous stories of people who endanger themselves as they reach out to help others, even now in our overwhelmed healthcare system.  We’ve heard of communities who forgive in the midst of atrocity.  Oddly enough, the openness, courage of these people, and forgiveness of these communities, serves to resuscitate them and bring them new life.\\n\\t. These are resurrection stories, and when I start to really pay attention, I realize they are all around me.  And I think these stories are unsettling because they challenge me to look at places where I would rather cling to the death of stuckness, fear, anxiety.  When I am overwhelmed by the present reality and  yearn stay in that dark cave, entombed like Lazrus.   Where I just don’t have to think or deal with any of this mess.  But these are the ways of death, and Jesus knew it well.  \\n\\tWas Lazarus really dead or just taking a nap?  Was he totally dead and brought back to life just by hearing Jesus’ voice?  I am not totally sure. But I find deep truth in this story.  Something in me resonates when I hear Jesus bellow loudly: “Lazarus, come out!”  There are places that I am enclosed in the dark, and sometimes it seems safe and even comfortable.  But the Spirit of the Risen Jesus is persistent:  “Anne, come out!  Resurrection is not something that happens in the future; it is a present reality…..let me draw you into it!  And this is what is might look like and this is how I want you to help me make it happen!”  Where does new life need to happen for you today?  Where is the energy and hope blocked within each of us?  Throughout our lives we are invited to be resurrection stories, and this is one of those times.  The Spirit of the Risen Jesus is calling us out of our places of fear and despair, darkness and death.  How might we respond to that call to “come out?”   Amen.\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t“On Time God”\\n\\n\\nIN GOD’S HANDS\\n\\n\\tWe are faced with some challenging texts this morning:  Through the prophet Jeremiah, we hear God threatening destruction of ancient Israel.  Through the gospel of Luke, we hear Jesus telling his followers they must hate their family.  Easy to be dismissive of these ancient texts, in part because they raise our hackles.  Perhaps they confirm our worst suspicions about a judgemental and punishing God.  About the irrelevancy of scripture in our modern day.  Perhaps we should all be down at Radio Waves this morning!    \\nBut I have learned through the years that when a Biblical texts irk or offend me, it is wise to pause, dig deeper and pay attention.  Let’s move into these troublesome passages, starting with Jeremiah’s vision of God as a potter.  Perhaps you have stepped into a potter’s studio and watched an artist creating pots from clay.  After observing for a while, you might wonder about this vision from Jeremiah that we are held “in God’s hands.”  How does this fit into your own image of who God is and how God interacts with us?  Picture yourself as a mound of clay.  You are repeatedly worked, pounded, even slammed on the worktable, so pesky air bubbles are removed from your bulk.  Then water is worked into you; too much and you turn to mud, too little and you crumble.  All this before you are pressed hard and tight into the center of the potter’s wheel, as it starts to spin with dizzying speed.  Pushed and pulled, you are turned inside out into unimaginable shapes, and then fired in a very hot oven.\\nLife seems that way sometimes.  In our personal lives, in our lives together as a church, sometimes we feel really worked over, subjected to the hot fire of immense and often unexpected challenges.  The weather brings droughts, fires or hurricanes; accidents or sudden illness seem to slam and pound us.  Ongoing dramas of problematic relationships, work that wears us out or grinding unemployment, all hold us tight and press us down.   We feel helpless in face of the cruelty or the miss-use of power by those in positions of authority.  Our own mistakes, our own sins, overwhelm us.  Does God actually send all these trials?  Or are these consequences for human behavior? “Just like clay in the potter’s hand,” the word of the Lord came to the prophet Jeremiah, “so are you in my hand.”  Is this good news?   \\nDuring Jeremiah’s lifetime there were tumultuous shifts of power in the ancient Middle East, with the breakup of the Assyrian empire and the rise of Babylonian power.  The political and religious elite of Israel was often greedy and corrupt, making unwise alliances, and Jeremiah spoke the truth as he saw it.  Here, Jeremiah struggles to warn the King of the consequences of drifting from God’s commitment with them, as the nation falls deeper into idol worship, economic corruption and mistreatment of the lower classes.  \\nSometimes a pot is spoiled in the potter’s hand.  Maybe the clay wasn’t mixed right.  The walls of the pot suddenly fly askew and collapse.  Stuff happens.  Notice how the potter in Jeremiah’s vision reworks the spoiled pot into another vessel, “as seemed good to him.”  God the potter is apparently a master of re-cycling and transformation.  The analogy may break down a bit here. The clay is not animate and has no free will, BUT…  If the clay can stay on the potter’s wheel, it has a chance of being reworked.   Think of our situation as a congregation, emerging from some difficult years of conflict.  In what ways are we called as a church to “stay on the potter’s wheel?”  How are we being remodeled into some new shape for some new purpose?\\nJesus understood that following God’s lead, staying on the potter’s table and letting God form and reform us, was not going to be easy.  In this passage from Luke, Jesus warns the crowds around him: following me will challenge your family and friendship connections, and your relationship with all that you own.  He goes over the top with his language: yes, folks, you are going to have to HATE both those closest to you and even your precious life itself.   What will this look like?  Jesus called it “cross bearing.”  As much as we may be offended to hear it, Jesus is on to something:  family, friendships and possessions can sometimes get in the way.  Is my walk with Jesus impeded by the extremes of pleasing, or maybe defying, a certain person at every turn?  Is my life so filled with the complications of acquiring and maintaining my possessions that there is little space left for me to be re-worked and transformed in God’s hands?  \\n \\tSome years back, I encountered a community of people who were so clear about being in God’s hands that it really rattled me.  About a year and a half after Hurricane Katrina hit the Gulf Coast, my husband Chris and I drove south to deliver a truckload of used musical instruments.   These were donations from people in both Grand Marais and Silver Bay, given to replace destroyed equipment in one of New Orleans’ flooded schools.  Heading further east along the Gulf coast, we joined a UCC pastor friend and her youth group for a week of rebuilding houses in Biloxi, MS at Back Bay Mission, a UCC supported relief agency.  This is the non-profit that our congregation supported over the years through the annual Shrimp Boil dinner.  I spent days covered in chalky dry-wall Spackle while Chris cooked meals for the some several dozen hungry volunteers.  Mostly I marveled at how little we seemed to accomplish in this coastal fishing community where homes and livelihood were barely recovered from Katrina’s devastating storm surge.   It seemed like one more story of “too little, too late,” in a place that local government and our wider country had already forgotten.  How was this place possibly still “in God’s hands?” I asked myself.   \\n\\tOne evening, tired and discouraged, our group talked with staff members of Back Bay Mission.  The UCC pastor who directed volunteers in this recovery work started playing the piano and teaching us a contemporary spiritual.  Pastor Don explained that he wanted us to sing this song at a preaching festival down at the large Tabernacle Baptist Church we would visit later that week.  We were doubtful about our Anglo ability to compete in any kind of choral face-off with larger, spirited African American choirs.  Pastor Don urged Chris take over the keyboard and we dutifully worked on our song.  And as we practiced, I realized the lyrics were slowly pushing me off a theological edge.  \\n\\tHe’s an on-time God, yes He is.  He’s an on-time God, yes He is.\\n\\tHe may not come when you want Him, but He’ll be there right on time.  \\n\\tHe’s an on-time God, yes He is.  I was disturbed by the patriarchal language of calling God “he” and I really wasn’t convinced that this is how God acts in the world.\\n\\tSeveral nights later, Chris led our small group in offering this song in the packed Tabernacle Baptist.  Our voices sounded meek and hesitant; I felt embarrassed.  But suddenly the full-tilt house band swung in behind us.  The three visiting choirs and the whole congregation were on their feet, singing and clapping.  Wow, we were starting to sound great!  To our amazement, everyone knew the song by heart and they joined in with exuberant joy, belting out these paradoxical words.  God may not come when you want him, but he’ll be there right on time. Many of these people had lost their homes, their businesses, even family members in the storm surge. Neighbors and friends had been relocated far away.  Their beautiful sanctuary had been flooded with 9 feet of filthy storm water and debris.   And here they were, in spite of natural disaster compounded by years of systemic racism and regional poverty, disappeared tidal marshes that could have protected the fragile coastline, our own federal government’s blundered recovery efforts, here they were in spite of all this chaos singing of God’s faithful timing!  Gathered in their newly re-built sanctuary, they were very clear they were still in God’s hands, being molded into a new future together.  \\nSometimes I feel like the clay pot that is my life has gotten terribly wobbly, misshapen, a mess.  Think of what is driving you nuts, making you anxious in your own life right now.  All of our instincts tell us to reactively just jump off that potter’s wheel of whatever situation is stressing us out.  Ignore, lash out, silently hold a grudge, retaliate, despair, disappear.   “Re-center me, Holy One,” I have to pray at times like this:  “God, I am in your hands and that is an ok place to be.   Show me the wider picture, open my heart to what I need to understand, what I need to face and confess and do.”  Pay attention this week to which situations, which relationships, which possessions seem to pull you off the potter’s wheel, out of God’s hands.    Ask to be as pliable as clay; pray to be reworked into new shapes, even into a new vessel.  We are in God’s timely hands.  And this is Good News.  Amen.\\t\\t',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\n\\n\\nTHIS UNEXPECTED FULFILLING\\n\\n\\tA colleague tells the story of a Sunday School song she used to sing as a young child.  She and the other preschoolers were invited to crouch down, scrunch themselves into balls on the church basement carpet and start singing together: “Read your Bible, pray every day, pray every day, pray every day. Read your Bible, pray every day, pray every day! \\xa0 “We started as seeds, all curled up,” my colleague explained.  “Then with the next verse, we would slowly unfurl.” \\xa0Read your Bible, pray every day, and you’ll grow, grow, grow (repeat).”\\xa0 Up, up the children would eagerly rise, responding to this invitation by stretching to the ceiling.  Then the third verse, “Don’t\\xa0read your Bible,\\xa0don’t\\xa0ever pray, and you’ll shrink, shrink, shrink (repeat).”  The children would quickly collapse back down on the floor, sprawling and giggling.  “We thought it was a silly game,” she mused, “but as an adult I now realize the song was right on.”   (  Debbie Thomas)\\n\\n\\tRead your Bible, pray everyday.   How do you find yourself responding to this advice?  With pleasure?  Or does it sound like a command, a harangue from a conservative church you left?  Is it filled with negative triggering that leaves you feeling uncomfortable, rebellious or just plain annoyed?  Does it sound like an invitation that you know you should accept, but your attempts at daily Bible reading and praying leave you confused, bored, and guilty you aren’t more consistent?   This morning I invite us to consider the first part of this childhood song, “read your Bible,” while acknowledging that the “pray every day” part is worthy of a different sermon.   Think a moment about your own life: am I spiritually shrinking or growing?  Think about our life as a congregation: are we spiritually shrinking or growing? How might an increased soaking in the scriptures of our faith grow vitality, courage and conviction among us as followers of Jesus?\\n\\n\\tThese two texts are offered by the Revised Common Lectionary, which are Biblical passages offered each week and followed by us, other Protestant and Catholic churches around the globe. The Nehemiah text and the reading from Luke, are writings separated by hundreds of years, but each focus on what it means to read and interpret scripture within a faith community.   \\n\\n\\tWhen I hear this Nehemiah text from the Hebrew scriptures, I picture a scene that seems quite different from our quiet, contained sanctuary with comfortable pews.  I see a crowd of exhausted and conflicted people, doubtful about sustaining a new life back in their devastated homeland of Judah.  After years of exile in faraway Babylon, with its unfamiliar Persian religion and social customs, these folks are finally rebuilding their sacred city and worship center of Jerusalem.  But so much feels foreign to them; nothing looks the same…familiar buildings, trusted traditions, people they knew, are all gone.  Perhaps it’s not unlike a congregation which has struggled through conflict and lost much that is familiar; old ways of doing things, shared assumptions of what it means to be church together, and most painfully, long-time members. Perhaps like us as we face tough questions of beginning again, the Jews wondered how to resurrect their life together.   Would they be able to reclaim a sense of their own identity as a people of God’s covenant?  The assembly gathers under the hot Mediterranean sun; men, women and older children jostling together.  There at the Water Gate, the one place in the city where “everyone could be present, even those considered ritually unclean”…a place for communal deliberation and decisions, where all were welcome (W. Carter Lester in FOW, Year C, Volume 1, p. 266).   \\n\\n\\tApparently the crowd stood and listen throughout the morning, as the High Priest Ezra read from the Pentateuch, the first five books of the Bible.   The Torah, their holy law.  As Christians, I’m afraid we have a rather warped view of what Torah meant to both ancient Israel and now to contemporary Jews.  Torah was always less of a legal system, which cramps and condemns people. It was the guide to how to live as God’s covenant community, showing justice and mercy to all.  It was considered to be a precious gift of holy instruction; “Your words were found and I ate them,” wrote the Jewish prophet Jeremiah, “and your words became a joy to me and the delight of my heart.”  As the gathered assembly, young and old, listening to the Torah being read that day, they cried out “Amen, Amen!”  We read that interpreters moved among them, explaining how understanding of the Torah was changing with their changing circumstances.   I’m reminded that we don’t do well just reading the Bible on our own: we need the guidance and support of those who can help us with historical context, translation concerns, how one piece of text fits into a greater whole.  For these people, Torah was a pathway, a tutor, a flexible and compassionate guide to living together in justice and in joy.  The people bowed their heads to the ground and wept.  With relief, with new clarity, renewed purpose.  As they soaked in their sacred scriptures, the way forward for them as community became clear once again.  What might this say to us as a congregation, as we move on from our reconciliation process into rebuilding our life together?  How will we be guided beyond our own preferences and even our best thinking?\\n\\n\\tThe Gospel writer Luke introduces Jesus first as a teacher of the Torah. Not as a healer or miracle worker.  Following his baptism by John the Baptist and then a time alone in the desert where he is confronted with temptations to power and glory, Jesus goes public as a teacher in the region of Galilee.  In our text today, Jesus has returned to his hometown and joins his family and neighbors in worship at their local synagogue.   The time of prayers, singing and Hebrew scripture would have been lay led, with the community’s men stepping forward to read from the scrolls.  Jesus stands and is handed the Torah portion for the day, and reads portion from the prophet Isaiah:  \\n\\tThe Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he has anointed me to bring good news to the poor.  He has sent me to proclaim release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, to let the oppressed go free, to proclaim the year of the Lord’s favor.\\n\\n\\tBy this time in Jewish tradition, these words had been connected to the community’s expectation of the Messiah who would come and transform Israel by literally saving it from foreign oppression.  After Jesus finishes reading, Jesus sits down among them.  People know something is up; all eyes are fixed on him.  From where he is seated, Jesus simply says: Today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing.   But the world looks no different; what does this mean?\\n\\n\\tOne Biblical commentator suggests: Note that Jesus reads from their own (his own) Scriptures, which is to suggest that the Bible is both the greatest friend and the greatest enemy of the community of faith. Everything that would challenge us most deeply is right here, right there, in this odd, disordered and difficult book, a book that reads us as much as we read it.  (Anthony Robinson, 1/27/13 lectionary web-blog).\\n\\tConsider this:  what “reads” you these days?  What is it that is wider than your own individual insight, even larger than our own collective perspective as a group?  What pushes each of us beyond fulfilling our own ego needs for security, esteem, influence?   What we do as church is to let a very old book called the Bible “read us as much as we read it.”  To both comfort and challenge us. The Biblical message has this tenacious way of fulfilling itself as we hear it.  It works in us in unexpected ways, if we let it.  The Bible becomes both “friend and enemy” to us as individuals and to us as a congregation, calling us to grow, not shrink. We soak in it’s stories and are compelled to reach out to the brokenhearted, to announce release to prisoners of war and perhaps even to immigration violators, to encourage each other through our personal “blind” spots.  And, here’s the tough one:  we are also challenged to “announce the acceptable year of the Lord” which was a code word for the ancient custom of the Year of Jubilee.  Torah prescribed that every 50 years debts would be forgiven, people would be allowed to return to homes and land from which they had been disposed, and slaves were set free. What might it look like if we proclaimed a Year of Jubilee here?  \\n\\n\\tChurch is where we come to get “read” by something bigger than our personal experience or best ideas.  To be re-oriented, given fresh eyes to see God’s world in a different way.  To be infused with renewed energy for the freeing and healing of ourselves and the world around us.  Thanks be to God.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\t\\t\\nTHIS ALIVE STRANGER\\n\\nThe Easter fanfare and full pews are over for the time being and and all my Easter chocolate has been consumed.  We have proclaimed, with a mix of certainty, wonderings and doubt, that Jesus rose from the dead.  Life triumphs over death!  Some of us may be asking “now what?”   After all, life around us does not appear very resurrected. The world continues to struggle with evil and human violence, and many of our own lives are filled with stress, worries and grief.   Now what?  What has changed?\\nAt the beginning of John’s text for today, it is the “evening on that day” after Mary Magdalene had unexpectedly stumbled upon the Risen Jesus in a garden outside his tomb.  The rest of Jesus’ disciples anticipate that the authorities will come after them too, as they have been seen teaching and healing in Jesus’ name.   As we dig down into this text, take a moment to notice that John’s Gospel says they are hiding “for fear of the Jews.”  But wait!  The disciples were Jews.  Historians have discovered that the alleged hostility towards the Jews of Jesus time recorded in the Gospels and Book of Acts, is a reflection of something that happened decades later.  When these books were being written! It wasn’t until the late first century, early second, that tension arose between the increasingly Gentile, or non-Jewish, Christians and the local synagogues.  We hear echoes of this hostility in the reading from Acts, where several of the disciples are being tried by the Jewish court in Jerusalem for their continued teaching and healing in Jesus’ name. Negative generalizations about Jewish communities originate in this false accusation that Jews were “Christ-killers.”  The occupying Roman authorities killed Jesus the Christ.  But this accusation of murder, and a conviction that Christianity is superior to Judaism, leads to the eventual persecution of Jews down through the centuries.  Right up through the Holocaust and yesterday’s deadly attack during a Passover celebration at a synagogue in San Diego.  This whole issue of the rise of anti-semitism is an aside to today’s story, but our complicity as Christians is worth exploring at another time. \\nIn today’s text from the Gospel of John, we see Jewish men and women, disciples of Jesus, eating and talking behind locked doors.  Suddenly, to their astonishment, a stranger appears in their midst.  “Peace be with you,” says the stranger in greeting.  Not unlike Jesus’ greeting of peace at the Last Supper. But they do not have a clue who this is.  Jesus followers do not recognize this stranger as Jesus until he shows them the wounds in his hands and side.  They are in hiding, feeling anxious, victimized, wounded by grief, themselves.  But then they see Jesus’ wounds.   Their perspective changes.\\nNoticing someone else’s wounds, their suffering, can bring us a helpful change of perspective.  So writes the former Anglican archbishop of Canterbury, Rowan Williams. (in his book Resurrection: Interpreting the Easter Gospel. )  Quite often we get stuck in our own loss, our own pain, our own woundness.  Williams describes how we ourselves may identify with Jesus’ sufferings on the cross and may be “consoled at the thought of God sharing in our suffering” through Jesus sufferings (p. 69).   Part of our sense of moving forward after Easter may even include a sense of solidarity with Jesus; God understands my sufferings through those of Jesus. (p. 69-70).   \\nBut, we may very well feel victimized by our situation or by what someone has done to us.  The problem, says Williams, is how quickly we can move into: “my suffering is deeper, more significant than yours.”  And if we’re not careful,  “nothing I inflict upon you is of comparable significance to what you have inflicted upon me.”  This can happen in families, in friendships and in local congregations. \\nIt’s as if we want to secure a righteous position for ourselves:  We find ourselves standing over and against the other, wearing what Williams calls the “moral armor of innocence.”  We make ourselves the innocent victims in a given situation. Be it ongoing anti-Semitism in today’s world, continued devastation of our planet, the denigrating Muslims or blaming others for church and family problems: It is so easy to slip on this “moral armor of innocence.”  \\nThe disciples encounter the Risen Jesus and are suddenly faced with their own lack of innocence.  They are confronted with their own culpability, their own passive participation in the violence that caused his death.  And they are faced with someone they don’t initially recognize, being so caught up in their past actions and inactions, their sense of suffering and hopelessness. \\nBut what about Thomas?  He apparently wasn’t in the room when Jesus first appeared to the group. He is the one disciple who gets labeled as the “doubter” because he demands some visible, tangible evidence that Jesus is alive again.  I can hardly blame him. And if Thomas finally got to receive some hard-core evidence, why don’t we get some?  I’ve run myself in circles over this question, and always wondered if I was missing something in this Thomas part of the story.  But this week I stumbled on a commentary by Rev. Nancy Claire Pittman, a New Testament scholar at Phillips Theological Seminary in Oklahoma.  She writes: “Here is the real problem with Thomas.  In rejecting the disciples’ good news about what they have seen (of Jesus), Thomas rebuffs the very friends with whom he has shared life for so long.  He seems stuck in his own sense of being excluded; perhaps he had only stepped out for a moment and missed the Risen Jesus’ first visit.  Perhaps he spent a week with his aging mother!  Now he has returned and brought with him this sense of missing out, being offended, feeling wounded.  Thomas’ words….carry a powerful sting: ‘there’s no way I will believe unless I see for myself.’”  “Throughout John’s Gospel,” continues Pittman,”….love and trust within the faithful community are the significant expression of the work of Christ in their midst.”  Thomas’ angrily challenges his closest friends’ testimony.  Love and trust are gone.  And it is “this kind of radical suspicion of our companions in faith,” insists Pittman, “(that) tears at the fabric of our churches today.” \\nShe concludes that the problem with Thomas’ doubt is that it is a “community-shattering doubt.”  Wow.  “if our churches are to be faithful to the risen Christ,” claims Pittman, “we must stop distrusting our friends in Christ.  At the very least, we must stop questioning motives, doubting dedication, and thinking the worst of our companions when they state a different opinion or offer a contradictory version.  We must learn to believe not simply in the goodness of the Lord, but in the goodness of one another – even when they deliver the strangest news, (like) ‘we have seen the Lord!’” (p. 399 and 401, Feasting on the Word, Year C, Vol. 2)\\nThis stranger, this Risen Jesus, approaches Thomas and the rest of them with a steady openness and compassionate words.  “Peace be with you.” Chill out everyone.   “As the Father has sent me, so I send you.” Stop hiding; You all have work to do.  Might it be that this is how God is with each of us?  Our insistence on our own innocence, in face of our culpability, is met with openness and compassion?  Our own assumed guiltiness is met with the same openness and compassion?  Jesus breathes on them, writes John:  and his breath brings the disciples back from their wild swings between arrogant innocence or despairing remorse….his breath brings them back from death.  Slowly it dawns on the men and women in the room that Jesus holds no grudge or resentment about their passive betrayal of him.  There, in his presence, they are not just remembering their dead friend but are now experiencing a living person. He speaks again, charging them:  “If you forgive the sins of any, they are forgiven them; if you retain the sins of any, they are retained.”  Would this be making any sense if they themselves were not experiencing Jesus’ love and forgiveness of their sorry selves, right in that moment?   As they begin to re-gain confidence and trust in one another?\\n“Stop healing and teaching in the name of Jesus!” the nervous religious authorities will later insist.  “You’ll bring down the wrath of the Romans upon us!” But the early disciples found themselves approached and forgiven by the presence of their Risen Lord.  We too are a body of people trying to witness to this reality of forgiveness and renewal.  We too are called to be a place where others can come to meet the Risen Lord, again and again.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.   ',\n",
       " 'August 25, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tJeremiah 1:4-10\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t Luke 13:10-17\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nOUR SABBATH WORK\\n\\n\\tAs we consider the Jeremiah and the Luke passages, I invite us to think about the larger question of “what holds us together as a church?”  For the Jewish communities of both 6th century BCE Jeremiah’s and 1st century CE Jesus’ time, the weekly practice of Sabbath observance was a huge binding force.  A day set aside from working, a time for families and friends to simply relax, eat together, sing, make love and enjoy the world around them.  It was an honored practice laid out in their Torah, their law given to them by God, intended for the well-being of their community.  But we live in a world where Sunday Sabbath time is often filled with chores, shopping, more working at our jobs, and maybe, a few Sundays a month, an hour of worship at our church.  What holds us, binds or ties us together as church?    \\nAs we wonder about this together, I suggest we sing the first verse of the hymn, “Blest be the tie that binds,” written by a Baptist minister for his parish of farmers and sheep herders in 18th century Wainsgate, England.   “Blest be the tie that binds, our hearts in Christian love.  The fellowship of kindred minds is like to that above.”   It has occurred to me in these last four months of serving as your Transitional Pastor, that the “fellowship of kindred minds” has had a rough go around here.  Many human “bonds and ties” among you have frayed, and some have actually been snapped.  I would imagine that for some of you, your sense of connection, of being tied to God, has also been challenged in the midst of all this.  A pastor resigned and lay leadership has changed and shifted. Some longtime members have left.  People are uncertain and anxious about the church’s financial and spiritual future.  In such times, we yearn for ties that will support and sustain us:  ties and bonds that are like the best parts of loving families, of happy marriages, of deep friendships and of a vital and healthy church communities.  \\n\\tBut as we look closer at the scriptures passages for today, we might notice that there also can exist ties that bind us up.  They entangle us, tie us up in ways that make it difficult for us to be the individuals and that church that God might be calling us to be.  There are ties that can bind a church community up, so it is no longer able to respond with openness and courage and creativity to God’s new call in its midst.  Jeremiah hears God asking him to preach against the political and ethical corruption of his day, to speak truth to power during a time of tremendous political and religious turmoil in the 600’s BCE in Israel.  He is told to speak not just to the Hebrew kings, but to actually call the threatening foreign nations of Egypt, Assyria and Babylonia to restructure themselves.  Not an enviable job description.  Jeremiah’s response is similar to Moses when confronted by God’s voice in the burning bush:  “uh, I don’t think so, God…I don’t even know how to speak!”  Jeremiah just doesn’t have the experience or the authority for this audacious, prophetic call; “God, what are you thinking?  I’m only a youth!”   \\n\\tSound familiar?  Perhaps there was a time when you had a certain perception of your abilities and you found yourself resisting a call to greater responsibility?  “No, I can’t possibly do that…I’m not experienced enough, educated enough; I’m not good at that, I’m shy, I’m only a newcomer, I’m just an amateur.”  How often do we let our insecurities tie us up?   Certainly people can get tied up in thinking they are better than anyone else, that they can do no wrong.  But we can also get tied up thinking we are inadequate, or even worse than everyone else, believing that deep down inside we are wrongness itself.  Either way we can get stuck in thinking we are better or worse than the rest of the human race.  Jeremiah’s limited view of himself bound him up and was keeping him from responding to God’s call.  “I will be with you,” God promised.  “I will direct your speech…come on, Jeremiah, get ready for action!”  \\n\\tI wonder if we can also get tied up in a sense of hopelessness about a given situation.  We just can’t seem to move into a place of curiosity about the future, we lose a sense of hope that things might change.  We can’t seem to develop a new future story for how things might be different, and how we can help this happen.  I see this happening on the wider political scene in our country and I’ve heard some it around here at our church.  This is why it is so important to me to be part of regular worship and scripture soaking, as a follower of Jesus.  Part of what we can do on the Sabbath, in worship together, is to re-imagine what might be possible in our own individual lives. We hear the witness of scripture, we experience God’s loving and transforming presence, and we become more receptive to who we might become.  In worship, we get pushed beyond simply appreciating the human ties between us.  Our imaginations get stretched to consider the wider container of God’s creative life force, God’s compassion and concern for us.     This is different from just coming to worship to be spiritually uplifted or emotionally soothed, although those things can happen to.  It’s about putting ourselves in the position, at least once a week, to be challenged to perceive the world differently.  To understand it as God might be perceiving and working in it.  Perhaps even to see where we, groups of people, family systems and church communities, can have ties that sometimes bind us in a negative way.   \\nMy sense is that Jesus noticed these problematic ties, these constricting bonds, in people.    This seems to be what is going on in this story from the Gospel of Luke.  We are not quite sure what is wrong with this woman Jesus sees in the synagogue that morning during worship.  She is described as being “bent over and quite unable to stand up straight.” Whatever it was, in the early 1st century such a physical ailment was understood to be the work of evil forces.   Evil forces were seen as tying this woman up, binding her and keeping her stuck bent over.  Jesus, without being asked, simply pronounces that she is “set free” or literally “untied.”  The woman stands up straight and immediately starts praising God.  But notice what happens next:  the local religious leader is irked.  Jesus has done his “unbinding,” his liberating, of the woman on the Sabbath.  But why was this a problem?  \\nThroughout Biblical and modern history, Sabbath laws have been a central and defining characteristic of the Jewish way of life.  They provided for much needed rest and rejuvenation of people down through the centuries.  The people would remember that God rested on the seventh day of creation, and also commanded them to keep this day holy in remembrance of their deliverance from slavery in Egypt.  The observance was so important for their communal identity, that by Jesus’ time, the Jewish tradition had become a bit bound up in many different rules about what you could and could not do on the Sabbath.  Jesus argues with the synagogue leader and says, “you would untie an animal who needed to be led to water, why shouldn’t I untie this woman from the bounds of evil?” Apparently, certain kinds of knots were exempt on the Sabbath, and you could untie them if needed. The woman’s healing and the metaphor of unbinding challenged the wider religious institution to “unbind” itself! \\nMight there be some “ties” that are binding this congregation and keeping it from moving into God’s future?  Are we stuck in wanting to return to some golden era of ministry that might not fit the current ministry needs?  These are things we can explore together in the interim period, before you form a pastoral search committee to find a new pastor.  Just like Jeremiah, congregations, can minimize their gifts, abilities and potential.  Some ties are blest, and some just bind us up.  Our Sabbath work is to open to God’s guidance in perceiving the difference.\\nThis will be the task of the newly created Discovery Team, to guide you in some “unbinding,” even as you discover the healthy ties that hold you together in Christian love.  The plan is for the Discovery Team to use our Sabbath, Sunday mornings to lead you all through both small group listening and shared feedback experiences, to explore who you have been as a church, what you value and believe now, who is your neighbor that you may be called to serve at this point in time, and what might God be calling you all to do next?   As this diverse Discovery Team begins to meet, it will be involved in some important reconciliation work of its own, seeking to listen to, be curious about and better understand one another.  To consider the helpful, and maybe unhelpful ties that are binding them at this point, as they begin their wider work with all of you. \\t\\nI encourage you to join us in worship for this Sabbath work, as often as you can during this interim period of transition. We will soak in the scriptures and pray and sing together and this Sabbath work will help us imagine a new future story for this church.   I invite us to be patient with the interim process, to pray for our ministry together. I ask that you be honest with me about how you experience my leadership.  Know that I am here with you, with gratitude and hopefulness for all that we will experience in this time of transition together.   The ties between us will only grow and strengthen, and God will use those connections for an unknown future that lies ahead of us.  Thanks be to God! Amen.\\n',\n",
       " 'June 9, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost Sunday Year C\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tActs 2:1-21\\nGrand Marais, MN\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n \\nTHIS UNPREDICTABLE SPIRIT\\n\\tThere are many paintings depicting the first century event called Pentecost. The one we have printed on the front of our bulletin this morning is from the Egyptian Coptic Christian tradition.  It’s hardly a realistic portrayal of a group of nervous men and women hiding out in a closed room, worrying about what to do next as we just heard in the passage from Acts.  What do you notice as you gaze at this reproduction?  The odd formalized symmetry of 12 men seated and gazing up at three women?  Hmmm…12 men disciples? But I thought the betrayer of Jesus, Judas, had disappeared and died at this point? The center woman dressed in symbolic red robe of Mary with her hands raised in blessing? Is that Mary, Jesus’ mother or maybe Mary Magdala one of his closet followers, in the middle?  But there is no mention of these women in this account from the Book of Acts.  The small flames positioned above each the women and men’s heads?  Acts talks about wind and flames, but what about this dove at the top, seeming to beam golden light out of its tiny beak?  A reminder of the dove at Jesus’ baptism.  No mention of doves in today’s text.  But this symbolic scene may carry an understanding of Pentecost that the early church was trying to articulate.  Something unexpected happened on that day.  Something happened that changed everyone in that room.  What might this suggest about the movement of the Spirit some thousands of years later, now in the 21st century?  I wonder how their ancient understanding of the Spirit  can help us discern our purpose and mission as a congregation today?\\nLet’s return to the scene as described in Acts:  A group of men and women, all followers of this teacher and healer Jesus, are now hiding inside a room in Jerusalem.  They are anxiously trying to figure out “what’s next?”  Jesus is executed and gone. Understandably worried about their own safety, they are uncertain about their future as a spiritual community. Yet many have seen Jesus over the last 50 days since Easter, talked with him and shared a meal together with his same-yet-different risen presence.   His final words were “stay in Jerusalem, wait for the out pouring of the Spirit which will empower you to witness to my teachings and presence to the ends of the earth.”  Having come to the big city with Jesus to celebrate the Passover, they now linger, instead of returning to their rural homes in Galilee.  Jerusalem is again overflowing with both pilgrims and recent Jewish immigrants from different parts of the Roman Empire.  It is the Jewish Feast of Pentecost which celebrates both spring first fruits and the receiving of the Torah, the book of Law given to the Jewish people as they journeyed through the wilderness, headed towards a new promised land.  The men and women in this hidden room are still fearing reprisals from the Romans who arrested, tortured and killed Jesus.  Quietly, they console one another with memories of their beloved teacher. They recall Jesus speaking of an Advocate, a helper, comforter who will come to them; this “Spirit of truth” who will come from God and testify on Jesus’ behalf among them.  They wait together, anxious about the future, unsure about what Jesus meant.  \\nSuddenly, a loud whoshing of wind comes out of no-where.  “Whoah….what was that?”  They turn to one another and are startled to see something like tongues of flame dancing on top of each of their heads.   Even more bizaare, they have each started speaking in a variety of foreign tongues they have never learned.  What?  Is this what Jesus was talking about – the Spirit will pour out upon you? \\n          The disciples hiding in Jerusalem were facing a whole new world where their old ways of approaching life just were not going to work.  They had thrown their lot in with this teacher and healer Jesus.  But what to do now that Jesus seems to be really gone? Well, maybe we’ll just go back to fishing in Galilee, they say to each other.  It’s understandable to want to reach for a familiar solution when faced with a difficult problem.  And sometimes this works.  In the church this might look like, the roof is leaking, send someone up there who knows how to fix the roof!  Need a new Office Manager?  Advertize, interview, hire!  In the business world, this is called fixing a familiar, technical problem with current know-how.  But, some problems take a different approach, where we have to think outside of the box.  The solution itself requires openness, curiosity, intuition, vulnerability, new learning.  How does a church figure out how to heal from major conflict?  How do we become more welcoming of young families, single people, the LGBTQ community?  How do we discern what God is calling this church to do regarding climate change, gun violence, poverty, racism, reproductive rights, immigration reform, and other social justice issues of the day?  These are what are called “adaptive challenges” in the business world, and churches would do well to pay heed.  Adaptive challenges may be clear but their solutions are not: they are not resolved in the ways problems used to be fixed.  Conflict? Oh, well, we just need a new pastor and everything will be fine.  And we avoid the adaptive challenge of changing our expectations about how we will communicate and behave with one another.  We have to push beyond, “how can we get people to not disagree” to “how do we really dive into this conflict, honestly, tender-hearted and respectfully, and see where this conversation and the Holy Spirit may take us?”  \\n\\tI’ve been helped in understanding this idea of adaptive challenges in reading a book about canoeing.  It has a strange title: Canoeing the Mountains: Christian Leadership in Uncharted Territory. written by a Presbyterian pastor and seminary professor, Rev.Tod Boisinger.  “Canoeing the Mountains?” I said to my seminary classmate who recommended it.  Canoes belong in lakes and rivers, not charging up a mountain!\\n\\tWhich, according to this book, is just what Merriweather Lewis and William Clark discovered in the early 1800’s when they set out to explore the newly acquired Louisiana Purchase.  These guys were canoeists, and they were prepared to paddle an inland waterway that would lead them to the Pacific Ocean!  The expedition proceeded accordingly, for a while, and then they ran into the Rocky Mountains.  Lewis and Clark realized that their whole expedition was built on a false expectation.  Not only did they have to abandon their trusted canoes, they had to face the adaptive challenge of crossing, surviving in, unknown terrain populated by unfamiliar people.  They ended up having to trust an “outsider” to guide them and to basically save their necks.  A young Shosone woman named Sacagawea.  She became their translator as they encountered the native residents of that land.  She was an indispensible guide to the natural environment for their scientific studies, helping them scout over new terrain until they finally reached the Pacific.  \\n\\tOkay, church, says Rev. Bolsinger: “paddling your canoes,” the way you once did church together, is not going to get you where you need to go.  Going sideways with our complaints may seem familiar and polite but it doesn’t serve the church as a whole.  We may have to leave the canoes of old assumptions and ways of doing things, and find new navigational and leadership tools into this uncharted territory.  Church structure, church governance, may have to look different in order to navigate this new terrain ahead.  We no longer live in a mono-culture where everyone seems to be Christian, looks like us and readily attends church.  Ours is a multi-faith, multi-ethnic nation, increasingly filled with people different from us.  And, contrary to what some of the media tells us, that is not necessarily a dangerous or scarey thing.  Here’s the part I found really compelling in Rev. Bolsinger’s book: Like Lewis and Clark turning to Sacagewea, we may have to learn to trust those who seem to be “outsiders.”.  It may be someone who is different from you or who hasn’t been around here as long as you.  I wonder if this is why the three women were placed in the center of the Coptic painting; typically the outlyers in a patriarchal culture, Jesus had welcomed women into his inner circle and so did the early church.  Sometimes it is the newcomer, or the marginalized person, who has the clearest insight into adaptive challenges facing the church.\\n\\tThe crowd that listened to the disciples speak in their own individual languages about God’s wondrous works, weren’t sure what to make of this bizarre commotion.  Are these people drunk?  And these disciples are outsiders, Galileans, or put more bluntly, country bumpkins.  But when Peter finally starts to speak, he goes to the heart of the adaptive challenges facing the Jewish community at that time:  They were living under oppressive Roman rule, where the established Jewish purity laws were further dividing the Jewish community between rich and poor, powerful and marginzalized.  Into this moment when the gap between present realities and the reign of God’s mercy and justice and peace are glaringly obvious, said Peter, God is sending the power of the Holy Spirit.  And Peter uses the words from the Jewish prophet Joel, written hundreds of years before, during another time of confusion and dislocation during the Jews’ forced exile in Babylonia.  Joel pointed to a time to come, when God would “pour out my Spirit upon all flesh, and your sons and your daughters will prophesy, and your young men shall see visions, and your old men shall dream dreams, even your slaves, both men and women, in those days I will pour out my Spirit and they shall prophesy.”  This is now, says Peter, this time of prophesy, visions and dreams coming from the “outsiders,” the ones you least expect, is upon us! Who expects this visioning and guidance to come from kids or our oldest people or slaves or the women disciples…..or a pregnant Shoshone Indian woman?  \\nI wonder who might be those perceived as “outsiders” who will help direct us into the new world of ministry and service ahead?  The ancient Coptic painting shows the disciples, and some typical outsiders, the women, even Judas, all hanging out together.  This may be an important clue about how we are to move forward as a church.  Hang in there, be open, be expectant.  May the Spirit of truth lead us together.  Amen.\\n\\t',\n",
       " 'November 17, 2019\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tPentecost 25C\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tIsaiah 65:17-25\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLuke 21:5-12\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nWHERE ARE WE LOOKING?\\n\\n\\t When I first moved up here, I was surprised to hear people say how much they disliked November.  No leaves, bare ground, cold, bleak, should season, nothing happening, they would moan. But I brought with me an odd appreciation for these in-between weeks right before Thanksgiving.  Glorious autumn is certainly over, but I’m not behind yet on holiday dinner preparations, Advent planning, my Christmas cards, gift buying.   Darkening mid-November has always felt to me like a reflective pause, leaving me quietly alert to changes and stripping down in the world around me.  \\nAs I wrote in our November newsletter, the bareness of trees, turbulence of the lake, chill wind, brings an air of expectancy.   God is astir among us, I sense.  Something, something is next.  Something is next in this church, I believe.  And, it looks like something is next for our nation.  There is an expectancy of something going to happen, which is for some deeply troubling, for others hopeful – it’s got us stirred up!  Wherever we each sit on the political divide, it is pretty unsettling to watch our country go through impeachment proceedings.  Whether we are paying rapt attention to the testimonies or are only vaguely aware that Congress feels compelled to investigate possible wrong-doings by a sitting President, it puts us on edge and leaves us wondering.  What could God doing in the midst of all this?  The Hebrew prophet Isaiah talked of a “new heavens and new earth” emerging, after a time of conflict and devastation of the people of Israel.  How might this force of restoration and renewal be working among us….in our nation, in our congregation?  I resonate with these words of Walter Bruggemann, the Hebrew scripture scholar:  “During November we reach the conclusion of the church year. We remember our dead and ponder the God of life. We begin Advent and the season of alert waiting for the newness that God will give.” \\nThere is a curious sycronicity with this moment in time and the two readings assigned for this Sunday.  In using the Revised Common Lectionary shared by Protestant and Catholic congregations all over the world, we step into a flow of scripture passages chosen years ago and offered to us as an orderly way to move through a wide variety of Biblical themes through the church year.  Isaiah brings a hopeful word to the people returning to their ruined Jerusalem, following captivity in Babylon; words of hope for restoration and new life that God is making possible.  This phrase caught my attention: “For I am about to create new heavens and a new earth,” proclaims God, “the former things shall not be remembered or come to mind.”  How does that work, I wonder, when we are trying to remember and name times of challenge and struggle in our congregation and learn from them?  When our law makers are trying to get to the root of some recent “former” things and actions by those entrusted with power and authority?   How do we move into the new…..remember or don’t remember?   Hold that question in your mind for a moment. \\nThe Luke passage has a strangely somber and anticipatory mood, as Jesus confronts his disciples inamoured perspective with the huge stone and adorned with gold rebuilt Jersualem Temple.  Huge crowds have come to the city for the spring Feast of Passover; Jesus and his followers also are here for these seasonal celebrations in the religious hub of the nation.  They stand just outside the enormous Jerusalem temple Initially built in the 10th century BEC the Temple was destroyed by the Babylonians.  In Bu Jesus’ time, it had been rebuilt over the centuries and now finally renovated to its previous architectural glory by King Herod the Great.  Constructed to accommodate up to 400,000 worshippers inside and out, huge limestone walls, parts of it covered in gold.  If a Biblical literalist wants to use signs of disaster to justify God’s punishment of certain people, they often turn to this passage, seeing it as a prediction of the end times.  But I don’t think that was Jesus’ purpose in noticing the impermanence of human building construction.  \\n\\tUsing imagery of apocalyptic, end-times disasters, Jesus punches through the disciples’ fawning words by cautioning them to notice where their gaze was fixed; what were they paying attention to?  He speaks of coming destruction and suffering.  It’s as if he was saying: You are focusing on the wrong thing!  All you see in this glorious human building will eventually crumble.  You will be like strangers in a strange land and you will be persecuted suffer because of me….and….. God will be moving in all of this!  Not that God causes, or punishes people with all these disasters.  But know that God will be moving in and through all of this.   Here is this dire and grim proclamation from Jesus during a week of impeachment proceedings that has stirred some of us up big time, and has taken on almost apolcalyptic proportions.   Here in the weeks following History Sunday, when we are looking through at some difficult and painful situations in our past.  But we can get stuck there.  I have started to wonder where my own attention and gaze, my attentive energy is going.  Am I actually looking for God at work, restoring and renewing?  Where do you find your attention fixed in these days? \\nThere was an emerging thread in Jewish beliefs in Jesus’ time that certain disasters would preceed the end of history as it is was known, and would initiate God’s full reign of justice and mercy on earth.  Jesus had already alluded to the end times in his teachings, calling himself “the Son of Man,” meaning “the Son of the human one,” a popular term from Hebrew apocalyptic scriptures for one who will appear as God’s emissary.  As Jesus and his followers stand outside the large colonnades and graceful porticoes, the disciples don’t seem to comprehend the looming disaster of Jesus’ confrontation with religious and political authorities, his imminent arrest and imprisonment. Their attention is elsewhere.  “Jesus, aren’t these temple walls and stones amazing!” the disciples gush.  “Incredible what people can do it they put their mind and backs to it!  Wow, awesome,” we can hear them mutter among themselves. \\nEasy to get enthralled, just like the disciples.  But be it the Jersusalem Temple, the World Trade Towers, our own homes or businesses, political movements, our church facility or a congregation we once knew….it can all tumble down, or good or for evil.  And it is also natural to become enthralled and overwhelmed by our own human disasters.  Impeachment hearings.  Grievances about what has happened to us in a congregation.  Where is our attention, our gaze, Jesus asks us.\\nThe Temple will be destroyed again in 70 CE, as the Romans squash a local Jewish uprising that dared challenge their repressive regime.  But Rome too eventually falls; it’s reasoned rule of law and massive military power crumbling.  In the midst of turmoil that seems to be with us in every age, Jesus reminds his followers that God is working in history.  Something incredible, God’s hidden workings, are about to be manifest; they are going to be born among you, says Jesus.  Do not despair over these difficult times, he admonishes.  Hold fast, be alert and watchful.  See how these times provide an “opportunity to testify,” suggests Jesus.  \\n\\tI believe we are asked to testify to God’s movement for peace and justice in this world, in the midst of what feels like to many of us to be an overwhelming mess.  To notice, following God’s compassionate gaze, who is out on the edge, who is vulnerable in this new day, who is marginalized.  And so we again hold a Transgender Service of Remembrance this Wednesday, on the day when people around the world testify to those who have been murdured because they were transgender.  What else needs to be done first, then done next and next, as we name and address the divisions and inequities in our community, in our world?   We pay attention to who is most at risk.  We continue discussion about how we might reach out to the LGBTQ community, to our immigrants and refugees.  We put huge energy into providing a Community Thanksgiving Dinner again so no one in town has to eat alone.  \\n\\tHere’s the thing in times like this:  Something happens within us as we gather together, claiming that the God’s Spirit of forgiveness, renewal and wholeness is working in our midst.  We refocus; we pay attention in new ways.  We learn to testify to the movement of the Spirit in our own lives, in the midst of good times and trying times and tragedies. We find ourselves spreading the word that life is more than meets the eye.  All the while watching, waiting, welcoming the new world God is creating.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",
       " 'December 24, 2010\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tChristmas Eve 5:00 pm\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tService of Readings and Carols\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\t\\n\\nO, Christmas Tree\\n\\tWhat is it about trees that speak to us?  The gentle unfurling of tiny green leaves in spring, telling us winter is finally over? The shade they offer in summer?  The air they clean each day? The fruit they bear, the leaves they drop, fertizling the earth?  The beauty of stark bare branches against the winter sky?  Such variety, such stately beauty, along our city streets and deep out into the forests.  Is it because religious traditions around the globe have revered trees, seeing them as a home for the spirit world, held precious and protected?  Is it the ancient memory of the protection trees offered our ancestors, who lived high in safety of their branches?   \\n\\tFor centuries, Northern Europeans have brought fresh pine, balsam, spruce trees and greens into their homes and churches at Christmas time.  Way before Jesus’ time.  Sometimes left bare, oftentimes decorated with twinkling lights, ornaments or Biblical symbols like our Sanctuary tree.   Evergreen as a visible sign of life in the depth of cold, dark winter.  Of eternal life.  Triangular shape, reminding us of the Holy Trinity. Such a rich symbol with which to honor the Christ child.   \\n\\tOne typically frigid December in Minnesota, my husband Chris and I had waited a little later than usual to get our Christmas tree.  Most of my life I have been living in or near cities, so I have spent a lot of time wandering around Christmas tree lots along busy streets.   When I was a little girl, our whole family would go to the lot and my brother and sisters and I would dart from tree to tree, debating which one was the most perfect.\\n\\tBut on that year when Chris and I lived in St. Paul, we went down to the local hardware store’s lot and looked around for a Christmas tree.  We saw nothing.  Well, there were somethings, but they sure didn’t look like Christmas trees!  What was there was a forest of these odd, skinny banchy things.  They looked like tall, spiney, green carrots, narrow standing upright in their stands, and someone had taken off that twine that the trees come all wrapped in when they come stacked in big piles in trucks from the tree farms.  But the trees looked like they were still wrapped in twine.   Instead of the branches pointing horizontally, gracefully relaxed and like the tree looks out in the forest, these branches were all bunched together and pointing vertically, straight up!  So each tree looked like a skinny green carrot, branches all tight together.  When I got closer, I realized that not only were the branches sticking straight up, but the sap in them was frozen!   The branches couldn’t move!\\n\\tThe man in the hardware store said, come back in a day or so, when it is a bit warmer, and they will have opened up.\\n\\tSo we came back the next day, and it was only a few degrees warmer, and the trees still all looked like giant green carrots.  Scrawney, ugly, frozen.  By now, I realized that we were just going to have to buy one of these things and see what happened.   The man in the store reassured us, “oh the branches will relax, once you bring it inside.”  \\n\\n\\tChris and I wandered among the huge skinny green carrot trees, trying to imagine which one would be the fullest, if it ever relaxed its branches.  But who knew if they would relax?  We had to make a decision and take an action.   Finally I shut my eyes and just stood there, waiting to be directed to something I couldn’t even imagine.  I had to take a leap of faith, trust the promise of a stranger, and imagine something – all evidence to the contrary.\\n\\tWe stuffed the tree in the back of our car and drove home.  I had my doubts about this.  We set the tree up in the living room, the tall skinny green carrot tree, and I headed to the kitchen to bake some Christmas cookies.  About a half an hour later Chris called out, “well, will you look at this!”  I came into the living room and saw that the branches had started to relax in the warmth of our home.  Within another 15 minutes the tree was open, full and beautiful.  \\n\\tSometimes it’s hard to see the promise right in front of us.  A frozen, skinny green carrot tree.   A congregation that has disagreements about how to move through and beyond a certain conflict.  A helpless baby lying in a scrappy manger in a nowhere town born to nobody parents.   It’s difficult to perceive the possibilities emerging.\\nSomeone inviting our forgiveness, or our participation in something new and challenging.  Something, deep in our hearts, urging us to change.  But we just don’t see it.  We hold back; we are unsure; we don’t commit; we want more evidence before we respond, before we take that leap into the unknown.\\n\\tWhat is the relaxed, sap flowing, green potential within and around us that may be difficult to perceive this Christmas time?  What are we unable to see or even imagine when we look out around our world?  Economic security?  Muslims who are not terrorists?  People of all religious faiths and no faith, listening to each other, learning about one another, living together in peace?  Forgiveness, re-focusing our energies and moving forward together into what God is calling us to next in this congregation?  What is difficult to picture in your mind’s eye in this moment?  What are you unable to see or imagine in your families, in your friendships, this night?   Honest conversations, deeper understanding emerging, long-time grudges disappearing? \\n\\tSometimes I think we just want to stay out in the cold by ourselves.  Maybe we are stuck, frozen, in our stubbornness, our resentments, our self-righteousness.  But God waits for us in the least expected places, waiting to inspire those openings, leaps of faith, drawing us back into the healing heat of God’s love.  God yearns to warm the sap of our spirits, to get us flowing again with self-acceptance and courage and hope.  Entering into our everyday world through the birth of Jesus, God invites us to relax our uptight selves and lower our defensive branches.   Here’s a way through, offers God.  Sit with this Jesus, listen to him, follow him.\\n“I am bringing you news of great joy,” says the angel.  “I am with you,” says God to all of us.  “Come into the warmth of my love and my purposes,” says God this precious night.  “Let the movement of my Spirit animate and guide you.”  Such is the invitation.  Merry Christmas.  Amen.   \\n\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\n                                         LUKE TELLS ABOUT JESUS\\n\\n\\tMy name is Luke. And I am deeply honored to be invited to speak with you today and to share this pulpit with my esteemed colleagues and fellow gospel writers, Mark, Matthew and John. I never met Mark, though both Matthew and I have read and used his teachings extensively. Some scholars think Mark may have met Jesus when Mark was a young boy. Which may explain Mark’s sense of urgency, the strong expectation that Jesus was to return any moment and usher in the end of time -   the immediacy of Jesus’ compelling presence fills Mark’s gospel. As I listened to Matthew speak with you last week, I was again inspired by his conviction: God’s mighty works happened throughout Jesus’ life and they are happening in our midst this very moment! Such a message is truly important to me, and yet I am so different from Mark and Matthew. They were both Jews who became followers of Christ, and they have both been nurtured and raised on the laws of and teachings of Judaism. I came from outside that family. My own parents were gentiles by birth: Greek is our native tongue.  No one is quite sure where I’m from, but suffice it to say I was a companion of the apostle Paul on his many missions (all those letters in the New Testament to young churches? Paul wrote those).  Actually, I’m a physician by trade. I wrote my gospel in a church that Paul helped start. It is incredible to me that something I wrote in 70’s A.D. has survived to this day! I’m glad it did, because I had a specific purpose in mind. \\n\\tI wanted to set forth my theory of the whole sweep of history, not just Jewish history.  A grandiose endeavor, I admit.  But I wanted to explain the place of Jesus and the church in God’s overall purpose for all of humanity.  That’s why I also wrote the Book of Acts, by the way, which tells about the spread of the early Jesus followers.  Matthew, and especially Mark, thought Jesus was going to return soon…possibly in their lifetime. By the time I wrote my book, it was very important to help people understand why Jesus had not returned yet. This was a real crisis for followers of the Jesus Way. Frankly, I think a lot people misread what Jesus was talking about when he mentioned the final judgment, the end of time. You have to remember during this era there were all sorts of strange and wild ideas about “the end of time” floating around. There were all kinds of Roman mystery religions and cults, soothsayers, and astrologers from the East….even Jewish writings about the apocalypse, like the book of Daniel. Add to this heady brew a very tumultuous political situation, with a lot of oppression from Rome, many people simply hoped that the end was near as an escape.\\n\\tBut as we all know now, the end of the world wasn’t near.  Returning in judgment at the end wasn’t why Jesus really came anyway, in my view. He came to begin changes in the present. People all through the centuries have thought Christianity was about the future, getting to heaven after you die, and that this life was merely transitional and didn’t matter much. Jesus would have been appalled by this view.  Being a good Jew, he focused on bringing about God’s purpose of peace and justice for humanity.  Here’s how I make sense of all this:  we are now midpoint in the long-range vision of God’s purpose.  God has a lot going on this world, with a lot of different people, in my view.  Part of the drama began with God’s connection with ancient Israel and continued up to John the Baptist. This may surprise you, but that wild-man prophet still had a lot of followers long after he died. The reason I describe John the Baptist’s parents, conception, birth and ministry so carefully is to show that he was important, but not as important as Jesus. John the Baptist announces and ushers in the earthly ministry of Jesus, in which the promised redemption of God really cranks up. \\nWhat do I mean by redemption? I don’t mean that everybody’s souls suddenly get clean and are headed for heaven. One of the first public events I record about Jesus is his presence in the synagogue in his hometown, Nazareth. The order of worship included time for guests to comment on the reading scriptures. A passage from Isaiah had just been read about God’s promised redemption: “good news to the poor, release to the captives, deliverance for the oppressed.”  This sounds like the song Mary sang when she visited Elizabeth, with Jesus in utero!  On the day of this Torah reading, Jesus stood up and said, “today this scripture has been fulfilled in your hearing”. (Luke 4:21).\\n\\tThe reason I wrote my book is that I was convinced that the church, the worshipping community of believers and seekers, was God’s instrument for redemption. God’s purpose is not that we have happy, private lives, living comfortably, and then to die and go to heaven. God’s purpose is that we enjoy God’s creation, and that we make it possible for all of humanity to enjoy the gifts of creation. I don’t know…maybe its because I’m a doctor…I’ve seen so much suffering, disease, battle wounds, malnutrition. I know in my gut this is not how God planned for us to live!\\n\\tI wanted to show my own worshipping community how to break through their resistances to becoming part of the redemptive work. I had to show them that God cuts through their stereotypes of who is worthy of their help and care.  This comes out in the way I wrote Jesus’ birth stories, which are different from Matthew’s.  I focused a lot of pages on how God births God’s messenger and son through the nobody Mary.  I guess that’s why I also included shepherds in these narratives.  To you modern romantics, shepherds may take on the gentleness of their flocks, humble, lowly men.  Not so!  In my time, shepherds were considered “low life”, dishonest, dirty and outside the law. I included the visitation of the angel host to the shepherds to remind everyone who Jesus really came to save. Not just people who are more evil than you or me, but people who are considered outside the fold of “proper” society and religious convention. What would this look like today?  Perhaps angelic messengers of God appearing to a Guatemalan migrant family on farm in Central Minnesota, to the meth dealer in the Twin Cities, to Somali refugees in St. Cloud, to the homeless person on the streets of Duluth, to the tattooed and multiply pierced young person in Grand Marais, the people on the other side of the aisle in current impeachment debate, people on different sides of a church conflict!  People outside of your sphere of acceptance, for whatever reason. This can be startling and unnerving news: God speaks and works through those people we least expect…often it is our “enemy”.  Makes me wonder how God might be working through this whole impeachment process you’ve got going right now….think about it….who seems like your “enemy” right now?\\n\\tConsider why I recorded Mary’s incredible song which she sang to her cousin Elizabeth. “My soul magnifies the Lord and my spirit rejoices in God my savior, for he has regarded the low estate of his handmaiden”. She was not from a very good family…to be blunt. She came from a real low life crowd herself, poor and illiterate. Her song continues, “For God has shown strength with God’s arm, God has scattered the proud in the imagination of their hearts, God has put down the mighty from their thrones, and exalted those of low decree. God has filled the hungry with good things and the rich God has sent empty away”. \\nDo you get why I included this long passage?  Jesus was big on seeking out the “lost” people of his time.  This song is a foreshadowing of Jesus’ ministry…of his compassion for the tax collectors, the prostitutes, Samaritans, the sick, children, women and those living in poverty. All the people who really did not matter in my society…those who were ignored and considered to be failures, worthless……and in some way, dangerous.\\n\\tThis is why I wrote my book…to tell about the Jesus who preached good news to the lost…to those on the edge. I wrote to tell my community that they were to continue Jesus’ ministry among the lost, the poor, and the needy, because this is part of God’s plan for the redemption of the world! I speak to you today to remind you that this is your work too as followers of Jesus.  My prayer is that you continue to be bold in this ministry!  A blessed Christmas to each of you. Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nJESUS AS LIVING WATER\\n\\n\\tOur scripture readings are awash with references to flowing water this morning.  Given that we have been in the “frozen zone” of an icey winter for so long, I find this imagery encouraging.  By early spring, most of us are eager for movement, some flow.…be it the rush of snow melt and unlocked streams,  our bodies finally outdoors breathing in the fresh air, spring rains coaxing out the slow seep of green buds.   Gently moving water is actually our first sensual experience, as we each floated for months in our biological mother’s amniotic fluid...there in the darkness, our own water-filled body suspended yet held firm.  We each come from a similar place, A mysterious primal abode, filled with sounds of another human heartbeat and dim noises from a world beyond that we had yet to discover.   A commonality we share with each person on the planet; something to ponder in the midst of human diversity, differences and conflict. We come from water, our ancestors crawling up out of the sea to dry land.  We grow in water, we are mostly water.  No wonder this elemental substance has become water such a powerful metaphor in religions and cultures around our water-covered world.   \\n\\t\\n\\tNo where is water a more powerful metaphor than in desert cultures, where the presence of water means life and its absence can spell suffering and death.  Both Jews and Samaritans would know this wilderness story of God providing water for the thirsty Israelites in the wilderness.  Both groups shared the same reverence for the first 5 books of the Bible, the Torah.  But unlike the Jews in the 1st century of the common era, the Samaritans did not accept the writings of the Prophets. They believed Mt. Gerizim was the place for worship of God, not the temple mount in Jerusalem.  Jews considered Samaritans to be impure because they married outside their faith and Samaritans considered the Jews to be unworthy participants in the covenant; these were arguments that went back by centuries and they mistrusted and distained each other.  At this point in John’s narrative Jesus has been teaching and healing in Judea in the south.  And for some reason, on his way to Jerusalem, Jesus makes the risky decision to get there by traveling straight north, passing right through Samaria.  \\n\\nWe have this account of a rather unusual conversation between Jesus and a woman he meets while traveling through the Samaritan territory.  It is the longest recorded conversation between Jesus and anyone in all 4 gospels.  That is in itself curious because Jesus is breaking a lot of rules in talking in even being near this woman.  Jews and Samaritans do not mix and mingle like this.  Drinking from a cup offered by an impure Samaritan will make you ritually unclean and you can’t participate in Temple worship in Jerusalem.  Plus, rabbis are not allowed to talk with women in public, as this also will make you ritually unclean.   So, there he sits by this well, tired and hot from traveling.  We see and feel his humanness; he is thirty and has no way to retrieve water from the well.  It’s high noon and Jesus disciples have gone off to try and find some food.  A woman appears with a water jar.  \\n\\nBiblical commentators have speculated endlessly about why this unnamed woman hasn’t drawn her daily water in the cool of the morning or waited for the evening.  Ah, she must be shunned by the other women water-drawers; she is probably sexually immoral.  Unfortunately, this assumption appears to have been the default mode for much of traditional masculine commentary on women in scripture.  Same thing happens to Mary Magdalene but that is another story and another sermon series.  This unnamed woman may be ostracized from her community in some way. Some surmise she is a prostitute, but the text does not say this.  She admits to having a number of husbands, but we don’t really know why this is. As a first century woman, you could be divorced at the drop of a hat.  Has she been widowed numerous times?  We remember that in ancient cultures, if your husband dies you can easily get passed between your husband’s brothers in the effort to produce a male heir.   \\n\\nJesus’ talks with her at length and breaks the rules in his culture.  These were rules that perpetuated the marginalization, the poverty and demeaning of women.  Implications for us in this conversation?  Here is another challenge in following Jesus:  If we attend to this story, we can’t help but wonder: Who is marginalized among us, like the Samaritans among the Jews?  Or more problematically:  What cultural rules of marginalization are you and I being called to break in Jesus name?  Who are we supposed to avoid or ignore, according to our predominate culture?  \\n\\nBRING IN COVID 19 HERE…..\\nAs a congregation, we may have become an “Open and Affirming” congregation, welcoming of the LGBT community.  Easy perhaps to welcome same gender couples with children who make there way to us; what would it be like for us to actively invite transgendered individuals?  What does it mean for us to offer radical hospitality and compassion to the truly marginalized? Gender fluid or transgendered people? For starters, who might we each have a conversation with this week who seems really  different from me?\\n\\nBack to the interaction at the well.  Jesus asks the woman for some water; she asks why he is asking her, a Samaritan, for a drink.  Jesus replies that if she knew who he was, she would be asking for living water.  “Living water” here takes on a double meaning; both fresh, moving water and now something else which isn’t quite clear.  The woman first focuses on the literal physical impossibilitiy of Jesus retrieving water without a bucket, and then this idea of a “water” that quenches all thirst.  I hear the resounding echo of every time someone tells me that they can’t believe in the Bible because of all the seemingly impossible things they can’t take literally.  We read last week of how the Pharisee Nicodemus’ conversation with Jesus:  the Jewish leader focused on the physical impossibility of being born again from your mother’s womb.  Nicodemus and this unnamed woman both get snagged on the assumption that literalism is the only way to understand the spiritual journey.  In both conversations, Jesus is pushing people to “think outside the box.”  Following this Jesus is not just about the correct comprehension or being a nicer or better person, like a car-jack that boosts you up a few notches.  Jesus wanted people to know that following him is going to involve a transformation of our inner selves, our inner spirit.  Something about Jesus, his living presence, can come into us and grows and enlarges.  It will grow our own love and compassion, transforming assumptions, perceptions and self-awareness.  This is not easy to comprehend. Here, Jesus describes himself as both giving and being the living water.  Jesus is claiming that he himself manifests, incarnates, all the blessings in their tradition which relate to water:  miraculous outdoor springs that bust out of rocks and save the people from death; inner springs that are the movement of God in one’s personal depths, an ever-renewed and mysterious upwelling of full life within us.  Who IS this man to say these presumptuous things? \\n\\t\\n\\tIt turns out that you can still go visit the called “Jacob’s well” today, in the land south of Jerusalem.  Water still fills that well, not from a spring but from an actual underground river that has run for centuries deep in the earth.  Jesus sat by this well that drew from a rushing underground river; talk about living water!  God’s power is that accessible to you, Jesus explained to the woman, “I am the living water.”  This is the deep mystery the apostle Paul would later try and describe in one of his letters: “God’s love has been poured into our hearts.”  “God’s love has been poured into our hearts thru the Holy Spirit which has been given to us.”  I find that these Biblical metaphors often elude my powers of deductive reasoning.  I have to almost go “side-ways” into my brain with some tactile experiencing.  And when it comes to water metaphors, one access point may be as close as our indoor plumbing.   Later today, when you turn on your tap at home, let the water flow over your hands for a minute.  Cup your hands and let the water fill and overflow them.  Close your eyes and imagine the Creator of the Universe pouring love and compassion and insight and strength into your heart.   Turn off the water, dry your hands.  Picture again what you just experienced.  Remind yourself of overflowing water filling your hands through the rest of the day.  Say to yourself: “I am one who has love poured into me through the Holy Spirit.”  As one who is truly seen with compassion and loved by God, just the woman at the well was seen, encouraged and accepted by Jesus.\\nHow can I live in this moment, in this situation, as one who so filled?  How is this living water over-flowing out of me to others?  \\n\\t\\n\\t “There is a man here who has told me everything I have ever done!” the woman said breathlessly, after she had run back into town.  “And he did not judge me, but listened to me and told me he is living water!  Could this possibly be the Messiah?”  Amazingly, on her word, in a world where a woman’s witness means nothing, the townspeople came hurrying to meet Jesus.  Samaritans, all, crowding around him, hearing and believing, inviting him stay with them.\\n\\tGod’s living water of abundant life poured into our hearts and overflowing to the point where we just have to talk about it.  As our thirst is quenched, we naturally pour out to others.  May we each watch for those moments this week where our overflowing hearts can share this spiritual, living water.  Amen.\\n\\n\\n\\nBENEDICTION\\n\\nGo into this week\\n\\nwith your lives overflowing with the love of God,\\n\\nyour hearts saturated with the peace of Jesus Christ,\\n\\nyour whole being\\xa0filled with the power of the Holy \\n\\nSpirit.

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTHE CHALLENGES OF PRAYER\\n\\nTalking about prayer can quickly lead us into deep and uncertain waters. Our personal experiences with prayer may give us a sense of blissful communion with a palpable and loving presence.  Or we may have been sorely disappointed in not having prayers answered.  We may face a silent emptiness where we wonder if we are just talking to ourselves.  Actually asking someone about his or her prayer life can feel really awkward, even invasive.  Many people consider their sense of connection with God and how their communicating with God is going, to be a very intimate and private matter.   What is prayer supposed to do?  What do our assumptions do we have about how God acts in response to prayer, if God exists at all?   How do we explain, much less cope with, unanswered prayer?   Especially when we her the Gospel record today, where Jesus tells his disciples, “ask and it will be given to you, search and your will find, knock and the door will be opened for you.”  Today’s scripture introduces both the Jesus prayer, which we call the Lord’s prayer, as a model for praying….one used in our worship each Sunday.  It also describes a story Jesus told in response to his followers request to be taught how to pray.  A cautionary note as we dive in here; most likely all of your questions and struggles or even disinterest in prayer will not be addressed this morning.  But the text invites us to begin a dialogue among ourselves during this time of transition in this congregation, one that I suggest we continue in a variety of settings together.  Because my hunch is that our prayer life, together and each of us alone, may be one of the keys to the reconciling and the moving forward of this conflicted and still hurting church.\\nIn my years of ministry with a number of many mainline churches in our denomination, I have usually found people interested in having discussions about prayer, even in exploring the the Biblical foundations, different theological perspectives and historical practices of prayer.  But actually talking about their own prayer life?  Or praying together in a conversational manner?  Not so much.  That’s more for the evangelical churches, people would say, where it was stereotypically assumed that people would talk of God like a vending machine: I prayed for a guidance on which cake to bake and the Lord said to me “chocolate bunt cake!”  Once, in one of my congregations filled with educated urban people, I rashly invited a small group together to explore prayer with me.  I asked them to commit to a 40 day prayer process described in a rather fundy-sounding (to them) book called “The “Unbinding the Gospel.”   8 typically rational, educated people joined me and committed, with some hesitation, to choosing a prayer partner among the group.  They agreed to do weekly check-ins with that person on how their daily prayer life was going.  Was I able to attend to this today, what was it like? What kept me from meeting God in prayer today? After much initial skepticism, they each reported back to the whole group that sharing with others about this part of our lives had helped them develop an unusual sense of closeness and deepening intimacy with both their partner and with others in the group.  What seemed to be happening was they started talking with each other about their experience of their relationships with God.  They would discuss the ups and downs, the wavering certainties and the embarrassing doubts.  Each of them admitted that this sharing was helping make their experience of God’s presence and trustworthiness grow stronger.  No one reported specific direction on cake baking, or miraculous cures of people they loved.  But they each noted that something within them was opening, deepening.  An inner GPS seemed to be growing inside each of them, that was giving quiet but increasingly steady direction to their daily lives.  \\nToday’s gospel text from Luke throws up a challenge about our prayer lives.  Jesus has just been asked by his disciples: “Lord, teach us to pray.”  He gives them the words of what we have come to call the Lord’s Prayer, which would be well worth exploring more in depth.  A sermon series? Discussion groups?  After lining out the prayer, Jesus follows with this insistent command: “Ask, and it will be given you; search, and you will find; knock, and the door will be opened for you.” It is not unusual to hear this imperative and to feel puzzled, even dismayed.  “Wait a minute,” we may find ourselves muttering, “I asked for help and it didn’t come;” or “I searched for that thing, that person, that, and it did not show up” or even “I knocked and banged and pounded on that door of opportunity, that door to my beloved’s heart, that door to my hope for a cure, and it remained firmly shut.”   Wondering if we are to blame, we pepper ourselves with questions: “Did I do it wrong?  Do I not have enough faith, whatever that means?  Did I not pray correctly or enough, or am I not worthy of receiving?”  Wondering if God is to blame, we begin to question God’s good intentions, compassion and infinite mercy, even God’s existence: “Is God actually more like the parent who cruelly gives snakes instead of good gifts to pleading child?”   \\t\\nThe question about unanswered prayer haunts us, and I for one do not know the answer.  I have learned that my wondering about prayer needs to be seen in the wider context of a relationship:  our relationship with the Creator of the Universe who seeks connection with and transformation for each creature.  In the Christian community, we go to the Bible to learn more about this Holy One with whom we have this birthright connection.  But sometimes in the scripture texts, God seems rashly over-involved with humans, getting angry and smitting this one, being pleased and rewarding this one.  Perhaps, as one commentator suggests, we would like God to be a bit more abstract, more detached, cool and calm.  But here’s the thing, he notes: “God at some remove from the world is less threatening to our desire to run the world as we damn well please.” So says the United Methodist theologian, William Willimon. (Willimon, p. 268, Feasting on the Word, Year C, Volume 3).   Through many scripture passages, God is all emotion: loving, waiting, pleading, seeking, begging, yearning to forgive and save Creation.   Over involved to the hilt, no boundaries, persistent, relentless.  There is something of this flavor in Luke’s story today.\\t\\nIn the Gospel records of Jesus’ teachings and actions with other people, we hear of Jesus also at full tilt: challenging, encouraging, calming, confronting, healing, comforting the poor and the rich, the high and the low, the marginalized and the prominent of his time.   \\n“Teach us to pray,” the disciples ask Jesus.  And Jesus is simple and direct, “okay, listen up.  When you pray, go for it.  Ask ask ask.  Ask that God’s kingdom of peace and justice come to earth and be part of that happening.  Ask for daily bread.  Ask for forgiveness.  Ask that you be able to forgive others and that your be able to deal with temptation.”    It may make us feel uncomfortable; it may seem selfish;  but Jesus taught that this is what we are to do and he said that God would be listening.  Always.\\t\\nMaybe part of our struggle is “we want to understand prayer as a mechanism, a formula, a practice so we can master it.”  (David Lose, workingpreacher.org, Pentecost 9C commentary).  In the prayer group I just described, one of the members spoke about how hard it was to start the 40-day of prayer discipline that we all agreed to.  “I wanted to do it right, to really ‘hit the ball out of the park’ in my prayer.”  We all laughed, recognizing that propensity to see prayer as a “mechanism, a formula, a practice” we could master.  Someone else chimed in:  “I guess all we can do is get up there and just swing the bat.  Just keep swingin’!”  Maybe the our question is not about “how prayer works.”  What we may really be asking is a relational question:  it’s about who.  Who do I assume this God is?  What is God’s job description in my view?   If someone I love is really sick, what happens with my prayer for healing?  What does it do?\\t\\nJesus concludes this particular teaching about prayer with a curious story about friendship.  It’s about how very odd it would be if you went to your friend in the middle of the night and asked for something you really needed, and your friend wouldn’t give it to you.  The story would hit home for the listeners, for whom hospitality to those in need was a cultural and religious imperative.  The resistant friend would be publicly shamed by the needy friend banging at his door in the middle of the night.  The needy friend’s “persistence” actually is better translated “shamelessness.”  This is the strange part:  Jesus seems to infer that we are to be not just persistent but shameless, over-the-top, in our asking.  Ask.  Search.  Knock.  Repeat.  \\nPerhaps, this bold and audacious clamoring for God’s attention is actually is good for us.  I have a propensity, as the responsible eldest child, to think God wants me to march ahead and do good works on my own.  Demanding God’s attention is good for me, as it affirms my dependence on God for all things.   Shamelessly bombarding God with our requests and concerns helps us acknowledge our need for God; our need for something beyond our rational egos thinking that can help put everything else in its right perspective.  Ask.  Search. Knock.  Repeat.  Give it a go this week.  And let’s find some ways to talk with each other about this deep, intimate part of our lives.  Amen.\\t\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nVESSELS OF HOPE\\nOnce again, the scripture texts seem complex and perhaps off-putting.  Biblical stories can be confusing, sometimes violent, and even offensive.  In our United Church of Christ tradition, we wrestle with the texts because they can often have a way of stretching our imaginations and perceptions of God, the world and our place in it.  We try to read the Bible in its historical context.  We use the best tools of modern scholarship to figure out what the various authors had in mind in their world, and then consider how this might speak to us today.  We say the various writings are “inspired” but are not the literal word of God.  Discussions about Biblical “authority” make us nervous; they seem to imply controlling people or controlling the church.  N.T. Wright, the Anglican Biblical scholar, has suggested that the word “authority” also implies that there are correct answers to key questions provided in the Bible.  We may assume that it is full of rules and regulations to be obeyed and creeds to be believed.  Not so, says N.T. Wright.   Neither is the Bible a collection of abstract and timeless truth, or a record of actual witnesses to events.  Wow, what’s left?  Narrative, Wright answers.  Stories – written from a human point of view, about God and humans interacting and struggling together to heal the world.  The Bible is narrative says Wright, a drama where the first two acts are written, Old and New Testament.  We are the current actors on the stage.  We are to imagine, create and play-out, the third act of this God and human drama ourselves.  \\nThe Jeremiah story is best approached as a symbolic action story and may help us consider what a third act might look like.  The year is 588 BCE.  The northern Kingdom of Israel has already fallen to the invading Assyrians.  The southern Kingdom of Judah, home of Jerusalem and the location of the prophet Jeremiah, is now besieged.  Desperate Jewish people, rich and poor, have streamed into the fortified city of Jerusalem; food is running out and the enemy is at the gates.  If you have skills, a craft, or money, you will be lucky to be dragged off to Assyrian capital of Babylon, otherwise a citywide slaughter awaits you.  The Judean King Zedekiah has finally jailed Jeremiah in exasperation. The King is no longer unwilling to tolerate the prophet’s incessant railing against corrupt governmental practices. He tires of hearing Jeremiah’s ranting that God will hold the rulers accountable for their behavior.  \\nJeremiah is imprisoned under palace guard, and a word from God comes to him.  It appears that in the chaos, a desperate relative of Jeremiah’s needs to unload some property…?  Perhaps the relative is hoping to get his family out of Jerusalem and head south to Egypt before the impending doom.  “What?” Jeremiah questions God.  Suddenly, this vision is confirmed when his cousin Hanamel arrives, pleading, “buy my field at Anathoth; you’re my relative and have first right of refusal here.”  \\nWe think we have been seen a depressed real estate market!  Everyone is trying to leave, the Assyrian’s are at the city gates; and this land in the Anathoth neighborhood of Jerusalem is basically worthless!  Has God chosen an unexpected and symbolic act to communicate with the people in crisis?\\nJeremiah carefully proceeds with the seemingly unwise purchase, signs the deed, obtains the witnesses, weights the money on the scale.  He even has his personal scribe, Barauch, witness everything, and has Barauch place the sealed deeds of purchase “in an earthenware jar, in order that they may last for a long time.”   In the midst of the chaos, God is directing Jeremiah to look forward.  Jeremiah’s symbolic action reminds the people that God promises, in the middle of the uncertainty and pending dislocation, that “houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land.”  Houses, fields, vineyards…when everything is disintegrating around them, God lifts up the future hope of all that makes life possible, stable and fruitful in their culture.  God promises that there will be resources and calm to once again dwell in the land of their ancestors.    \\nThis is the stuff of “hanging in there,” of continuing to lean into God’s promises when things look truly bleak.  What’s the next act look like for us?  We can probably each recall a disappointments and maybe even a disaster that made us want to just fold up shop.  Why keep investing in a relationship when there has been such disappointment?  How do we keep running this business as returns dwindle?  Why keep investing in a particular congregation where there has been betrayal and conflict?  Does “having hope in the future” just look impractical and unwise?     \\nI was reminded this week of another narrative, the story of the Lutheran Theologian and Pastor, Dietrich Bonhoeffer, who was arrested and killed by the Nazis for allegedly plotting with others to assassinate Adolf Hitler.  A few months before he was imprisoned, he wrote these words about how we must keep investing in the future, even in desperate times:  \"...There remains for us only the very narrow way, often extremely difficult to find, of living every day as if it were our last, and yet living in faith and responsibility as though there were to be a great future. It is not easy to be brave and keep that spirit alive, but it is imperative.\" \\nBonhoeffer reflects on this story from Jeremiah, as he later corresponded with his fiancée Maria von Wedemeyer, from his prison cell.  He writes to her: \"When Jeremiah said, in his people\\'s hour of direst need, that \\'houses and fields and vineyards shall again be bought in this land\\', it was a token of confidence in the future. Our (own plans for) marriage must be a \\'yes\\' to God\\'s earth. It must strengthen our resolve to do and accomplish something on earth.\"  \\nThere are different perspectives on just what “confidence in the future” may be.  Some would say this is about rewards in heaven.  And it is a common misperception that today’s text from the Gospel of Luke, is a cautionary tale about our future in the afterlife.  If we are rich and greedy, and ignore the poor, we will go to some place of punishment, and if we are poor, we will go to some kind of heaven in the bosom of the Hebrew patriarch Abraham.   I don’t think this was Jesus point in telling this story.  His challenge in not unlike Bonhoeffer’s:  our confidence, our hope, in God’s good future is about strengthening our resolve to participate in the good in this life.  How might we bring hope to someone in need, someone who crosses our paths while we are living? Jesus asks his listeners.    \\n        Everyday the rich man had a chance to be that hope to the poor man reduced to begging at his gate.  But the man with the resources lived in a culture that conditioned him to ignore Lazarus sitting at his front door, because Lazarus would be considered ritually “unclean” with his open skin lesions and his constant contact with ritually “unclean” dogs. So often we talk sadly about “the poor” or the “disadvantaged.”  And sometimes we generalize about these people, making hopeless assumptions about their motivation or morals.  We generalize about a lot of people, actually:  “those teenagers,” “the elderly,” “those Muslims,” “that bad neighborhood,” “the druggies,” “those people who were against the pastor.”  Our generalizing carries a sense of futility: why interact with or help these groups?  We can lose track of the individuals, each with a separate personhood and unique need.  Empathy disappears.  We lose track of our call to carry the hope of God’s good future to others. \\nI think of the ways this congregation has brought its collective confidence in a good future to the table, year after year.  Putting on a community-wide Thanksgiving dinner, for one thing, and the willingness to do this huge event again this November, even in the midst of reduced person-power at our church.  We choose to reaffirm that this sign of extravagant hospitality, a meal served free to anyone, reflects our values as a congregation. We become like those earthenware vessels that held the deeds for land that seemed valueless at the time.  A church becomes a “holding place” as we listen to people’s stories and respond to their needs.  What others ways might we become become a vessel of hope for people who feel valueless and hopeless?.  We’re beginning to explore how we, a small church in an area of relatively few immigrants, might better understand and address the challenges of immigrants throughout Minnesota, as well as at our southern borders.  This is us participating in the next “act” of God healing the world.\\nIn Jesus’ parable, the rich man is punished at death not because he was rich and greedy.  It’s because he just didn’t see; he averted his eyes and didn’t pay attention to the person right at his door.  Who will we finally “see” this week, that we really didn’t notice before?  It could be on the news or something we read.  Where might we see and affirm value, where the rest of the world sees nothing?  We write the next act in the Biblical narrative with our very lives.  Thanks be to God that these people will cross our paths, so we may become vessels of hope.   Amen.\\n\\t  \\n\\t\\n\\n\\n\\n  \\n\\t  \\n\\n',\n",

He’s instructing a large group of them, 70 or so men and women to go ahead of him, like an opening act before the famous band comes on.  They are to travel lightly and sort of “warm up the crowd” before Jesus arrives in town.   And notice, he does not instruct this group with much of a message: only vague words about peace and God’s kingdom.  No, “remind everyone they are sinful and that they better accept Jesus into their hearts or they will go to hell.”   Jesus tells the 70 to accept lodging from whoever welcomes them and when they enter the dwelling to say “Peace to this house.”  Then, after eating whatever it is they are served (don’t get caught up in dietary law or your own squemishness), they are to heal anyone who was sick. Then, say “the Kingdom of God has come near to you.”  Jesus final instructions were that if they were to enter a town and no one welcomes them.….well, don’t force it.  Let it go, let it go, like shaking dust off your feet.  I find this to be a perplexing and challenging set of instructions.\\n“Peace to this house” and “the Kingdom of God has come near to you.”  These seem like rather mild statements to say, but apparently not.  Something about “Peace to this house” and the “Kingdom of God has come near to you” can be offensive, even radically incendiary, to people.  Why is that?  What would trigger people to say “no way” to such seemingly innocuous statements?\\n\\tIn the New Testament, the phrase “Kingdom of God,” is sometimes translated “kingdom of heaven:”  Jesus used these words a lot and the concept itself was nothing new.  Language about the “kingdom” or “reign” of God went way back in the Jewish tradition and drew on the metaphor of a monarchy, with God as the supreme, just and compassionate (and male) King.  It referred a realm of peace and justice under God’s rule of mercy, an earthly utopia.  A time and place “where human beings lived together in harmony and fair distribution of economic assets.” Everyone would have enough (Bourgeault, Wisdom Jesus, p. 30).  Throughout their history, the Jewish “prophets and visionaries labored to bring into being their respective versions of this kind of Kingdom of Heaven.”  “On earth as it is in heaven,” Jesus would later teach.  They all believed this was God’s intent for humans since the beginning of time.  “But somehow these earthly utopias never seemed to stay put for very long.”  Human desires for security and survival, esteem and control, would usually prevail; conflict would rage.  Peace and justice would wax and wane, depending upon who was in power.\\nBut notice that in Luke’s narrative, Jesus doesn’t speak about getting into the Kingdom of God.  This Kindgom is not being described as a locality, or, as many would later assume, a place we might arrive after we die.  At several points, Jesus talks about “seeing” the Kingdom of God, or better translated, “perceiving” God’s kingdom, a reign of interdependence, compassion and justice among us.  What is different about Jesus, is that he speaks as this reality is already here, all around and even within us.  “When his followers wanted to proclaim him the Messiah, the divinely anointed king of Israel who would inaugurate this reign of God’s justice upon the earth, Jesus shrank from all that and said, strongly and unequivocally, ‘ My kingdom is not of this world.’” (Bourgeault p. 30).  \\nThe Gospel of John tells a story of a conversation Jesus had with one of the Jewish legal scholars and teachers, Nichodemus.  Jesus insisted that “no one can see the Kingdom of God unless they are born again/anew.” It’s as if Jesus was saying, “dig deeper…things are not as they seem…you must begin again, re-wire your way of thinking about these things.”  You have to see differently.  All this sounds rather ambiguous.  But great spiritual teachers do this:  they tell stories, riddles, koans in Japanese Zen Buddhism, that confound the brain’s usual ways of perceiving and explaining great mysteries.  Why?  Because the rational, logical brain is not the primary tool for the job when it comes to perceiving the spiritual realm and God’s activity among us!  Paul will later write to the church in Ephesus that they should seek to have  “the eyes of their hearts enlighted…”  Like putting on a different set of lens.  Seeing the world, each other, as God sees us.  Equal, precious, beloved.  I want a pair of these lens!  \\nContemplative writers through the years have claimed that perhaps the Kingdom of God is an interior place you come from in Jesus’ experience.  Perhaps Jesus was describing a “whole new way of looking at the world, a transformed awareness that literally turns this world into a different place.” (p. 30).  If that sounds weird, let’s see if we can imagine it:  A transformed awareness that melts the differences “between Muslims and Christians, between Republicans and Democrats or even between between God and humans”. Cynthia Bourgeault, a contemporary Episcopal author and mystic, suggests it is as though Jesus is inviting us to step into another dimension that is there, welcoming us already.” (The contemporary Episcopal writer and mystic Cynthia Bourgeault  Wisdom Jesus: Transforming Heart and Mind.  p. 30.)   \\nIn my experience, I have to practice this way of seeing because it doesn’t come naturally.  My brain wants to make distinctions between things.  I have to practice not seeing separation.  I have to practice looking through a lens of Oneness.  Such as, gazing at a specific tree and not seeing a separate entity but a conjoined member of a vast network of trees, connected below the surface, beyond my vision, intertwined in a sprawling network of roots that communicate minerals and hydration and even messages to one another.  Or, contemplating the person passing me on the street and imagining the generations of humans that came before him, the mother that birthed him.  Imagining the myriad of experiences that may have brought a cranky or problematic person to this moment.  Staring up at the night sky and picturing all the distant rays of light that have traveled eons just to hit my eyes in that moment, pondering how the past and present interweave in what I am seeing.  Or dealing with someone who is driving me to distraction and seeing that person as a beloved child of God, worthy of both my compassion and being held accountable for their actions.  If I don’t work on contemplating interconnection, Oneness, I spend much of my day only making distinctions: is this person for or against the church.  Are North Koreans or immigrants crowding our borders evil or good, will such-and-such a person be a pain-in-the-neck today or be nice, will someone like me or not.  Binary thinking it’s called, the system installed in our brains that enables us to is make distinctions between things, to make rational judgements that direct our actions. It’s a helpful way to think…..sometimes.  Little kids learn this early: is it a dog or a cat? An ear or a nose?  We need our brains to think this way for a number of questions:  Time to change the oil in my car or not?  Is the banana ripe or not ripe? We perceive things through seeing the differences between them.  Which can quickly move on to judgements about good/bad, included/excluded, right/wrong.  Our identity gets caught up in the process:  I am this, but not that.  As though I were a static “thing” separate from all I are experiencing.  And as a separate self, we worry about protecting and defending ourselves, we worry about scarcity and feeling powerless.  I think part of why Jesus’ words, “the Kingdom of God has come near to you,” was so unsettling to people is that he was signaling that their identity and their perceptions were often…..well, a mirage.  An illusion.  We see only separateness, we define everything out of our own experience.  We miss the oneness that all great wisdom teachers of various spiritual traditions are pointing to.   Love your neighbor as yourself,” Jesus would teach. Could it be that we are the neighbor ourselves?  Bear one another’s burdens, Paul writes to the church at Galatia.  Why?  Because the human burdens are all one….they are meant to be shared.\\n\\t\\xa0What is Jesus asking his listeners to see, to give their heart to, to trust in? \\xa0  For starters, a shift in consciousness, a deeper living that comes from seeing through the lens of God’s reign. Out of this fuller connection with all that is in this moment, a empathy and understanding for other humans grows.  Our awareness of our place within creation evolves.  And we will naturally desire to care for all of it.  We will seek to bear one another’s and our planet’s burdens with humility and joy.  So may it be.  Amen.\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tPentecost 18C\\n\\nBottom of Form\\n\\nBELIEVING FORWARD\\n\\tOne of the reasons it’s important to be connected with other churches in our wider United Church of Christ denomination, is that it can help us gain some perspective in challenging times.  We can get focused on our own disagreements and feelings, our own site-specific trials and polarization.  For a wider view, I’ve been thinking lately of an unexpected disaster that happened three years ago this month, at church in the San Francisco Bay area.  First Congregational United Church of Christ in Berkeley was a congregation I knew well from my years of ministry in northern California.  For well over a century, this big urban church had been a center of theological liberalism and social justice leadership in the San Francisco Bay area.  Sitting on the edge of the UC Berkeley campus, the congregation was on the forefront of fighting for women’s suffrage, the rights of interned Japanese Americans, civil rights for people of color, nuclear disarmament, and more recently partnering with Black Lives Matters to address continuing racial injustice.  But during one awful October week, several of the church’s buildings were destroyed by a roof construction fire and the main Sanctuary was unusable due to considerable smoke and water damage.  Frustration and grief overwhelmed everyone:  how did this happen?  Who was at fault? Now what?  In the midst of this sudden devastation, their Senior Minister, Molly Phinney Baskette, wrote a pastoral letter to her congregation: “are we paying close attention to the story we are telling about this event?” she asked.  “Do we tell a story about fear and despair, or a story about hope?  Following this terrible fire, will this be a time of hunkering down for us as a church, of restricting programming and staff under the weight of costly repairs?”  She noted that “A few of the TV news channels, which love to light up the lizard brain to spike ratings, told the story of fear and despair: heartbreaking devastation, toddlers from our nonexistent day care fleeing the building, danger of building collapse. They weren’t really interested in our composure.”  “Our public statements about resiliency and strength, about people being more important than things, about vision for the future, didn’t make their newscasts,” Rev. Phinney Baskett continued.  She described how one of their church musicians had “encountered white supremacists demonstrating Friday night near our church, preaching that the fire was an act of God in retribution for our Black Lives Matter banner. They were selling a vengeful God, a border-wall God, the God whose love is scarce and finite….But you,” she writes to her people, “you have been telling the hope story of our fire. You are honoring your grief and your memories, but not letting them get in the way of believing forward that God will do great things among us.” (from MFB Facebook page).\\n\\tI come to our texts this morning, wondering our hope story, about how God will continue to do great things among us.  I wonder about the story being told around town about our congregation: what do you hear?  What do you find yourself saying?  Are these stories of fear, grievance and despair?  “The church will never be the same again….I’m so angry I just can’t be part of it anymore…..I’m so hurt and sad I just can’t engage with those people.”  Or are we telling stories of hope for the future?  Not white-washing the past or ignoring it, but holding out a sense of what might be possible moving forward.  We are called to “believe forward that God will do great things among us” says Rev. Phinney Baskette.  Looking at our text from Hebrew scriptures this morning, I wonder how on earth the prophet Jeremiah was able to “believe forward.”  The late 6th century BCE was a time of invasion and devastation for the Jewish nation.  How was the prophet able to speak of God continuing to do great things among the Jewish people?  Jeremiah sends word to those who had been dragged from Jerusalem and exiled to Babylon: “5Build houses and live in them; plant gardens and eat what they produce…have sons and daughters…seek the welfare of the city where I have sent you into exile, and pray to the\\xa0Lord\\xa0on its behalf, for in its welfare you will find your welfare.”  In a time of fear and deep frustration, where does hope come from?\\n\\tThis passage from Luke describes a group that also had a legitimate grievance story. How do you “believe forward that God will do great things among you” if you have a dreaded and very visible skin disease?  In those days, people afflicted with leprosy were shunned by their surrounding society; they were seen as sinful, unclean, and outside of God’s grace.  If you happened to somehow get cured of an illness like leprosy, you were required to see a Temple priest for a special cleansing ritual.  Only then would you be seen as spiritually fit to rejoin the community as a healed, clean and whole person. \\nThe gathered crowd would be not only shocked to see hopeful things happening to a group lepers.  They would be surprised to hear polite, grateful words coming from the Samaritan leper.  The Samaritan, the foreigner who is not liked or appreciated by the Jews (and the feeling was mutual for the Samaritans), is the only person in the story who says “thank-you” for his healing. He steps forward and falls at Jesus feet, praising God.  Jesus wonders out loud, so the crowd won’t miss it: “weren’t there 10 of you?  Get up and go on your way; your faith has made you well.”  The Samaritan is the one whose faith doesn’t sit within him like an inert block of belief.  His faith is a verb; he is acting faithfully as he expresses his gratitude.  Something about this has made him well.  \\n\\tWhat is it about gratitude that might bring healing and hope?  A recent study by two social science professors, (Robert A. Emmons and Michael E. McCullough, conducted a study on “Gratitude and Thankfulness Dimensions.”) explored whether or not a grateful outlook had a measurable effect on psychological and physical well-being. Did it really reduce fear, resentment and anxiety in people?  The researchers looked at the difference between “counting your blessings” and “counting your burdens.”   Is it any wonder that they discovered that when people regularly make a weekly listing of life’s blessings things seemed better?  These people had “a more positive and optimistic appraisal of one’s life, more time spent exercising and fewer reported physical symptoms.” (p. 386).  “Grateful people are more likely to acknowledge a belief in the interconnectedness of all life and a commitment to and responsibility to others” (McCullough et. al., 2002). \\n\\tThere also was a curious “spiraling effect” where the “experience of gratitude, and the actions they did when they felt grateful, built and strengthen social bonds and friendships.” (p. 388)  And then they would end up feeling more grateful….and more connected….and more grateful.   \\n\\tAs I pondered the Jeremiah passage in light of these learnings about gratitude, I realized that the prophet was telling the Jewish people pretty much the same thing.  Their country was overrun by the Assyrians, they had been dragged off to live in exile in Babylon.  They had lost their beautiful city Jerusalem and their religious center the Temple.  They had cause to be fearful, angry and doubtful about connecting with God at all in this foreign land.  Jeremiah proclaims that God wants them settle in, to marry, work and contribute to the welfare of their new rulers, the Babylonians.  And in doing so, in connecting with their surroundings and gratefully acknowledging what was there in the midst of the difficulties, they too would prosper.  “You are connected to your captors; pray for them. Be here…be here in what is right in front of you…pay attention to it, connect with it…I am here with you,” says God.  \\n\\tGratitude is not a cure for everything, like clinical depression or cancer, poverty or deep grief.    But something about acknowledging the things we are grateful for, changes us. The congregation of First Church Berkeley experienced this reality: Gratefulness that no one was injured, gratefulness for the firefighters, for strangers sending money for the rebuilding fund, for a willingness to dig in but not hunker down in fear and frustration.  In the midst of a mess, they were compelled to rethink their church programming and space useage; it pushed them to become a congregation somewhat different from what they had been, with a renewed sense of what God called them to next.  The gratitude study reveals that even before we actually experience the emotion of gratefulness, in giving thanks we will start to think more clearly. We get more flexible and creative in our thinking, which in turn helps us deal with stress and adversity better (p.388).  Flexible and creative thinking, considering things from someone else’s perspective, will allow us to sort through the past and learn from it.  This helps us “believe forward” into God’s new future for this church.\\n\\tThe feared and marginalized Samaritan man who turned back and fell at Jesus’ feet, acknowledged his connectedness to Jesus, his receiving of something of value.  He thanked and praised God, and all of this changed him.   Blessings surround us, in the midst of all that is wrong here and in this world.  It is ours to pay attention and give thanks; allowing fear and resentment to be replaced with hope.   Amen.\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nTRINITY OVERFLOW\\n \\n\\tI imagine we have a variety of perspectives in this congregation about God.  What is God is up to in the course of natural disasters, personal tragedies and in this world of ours in general?   I personally do not believe that God saves certain people from suffering and choses not to save others.  For me, this is not God’s job description: I would claim that God is in the middle of human suffering and joy.  But if that is true, how are we to understand what difference this can make in our lives?\\nLast week we heard again the wild story of Pentecost, where Jesus’ disciples were suddenly filled with the power of the Holy Spirit sent by God.  They had been grieving and struggling with the difficult question of “what on earth was God up to in letting Jesus be killed?”  But after Pentecost, these men and women start to courageously speak out about being filled with the Holy Spirit and a profound sense of new life. Risking everything, they step forward, testifying about their personal, life-changing experiences of God, Jesus and the indwelling of God’s renewing power.   Did the God of the first century act differently than the God of the 21st?  What is God’s job description, anyway?\\n\\t Oddly enough, questions like these make the notion of the Trinity helpful for me.  God shows up in three ways, three persons: Father/Mother Creator, Brother/Savior Jesus and Sustainer Holy Spirit.  This dusty ancient doctrine challenges my assumptions about how God works in the world and reminds me that God is not some magic Santa in the sky waiting to reward or punish me.  Traditionally, the Sunday following Pentecost is designated as Trinity Sunday.  It took the official Christian church about 300 years to formulate this symbolic language about Father-Son-Holy Ghost.   All this creedal debate was apparently stimulated by considerable controversy about Jesus himself.  Who was he?  Divine in some way, a divine creature in human disguise, or all human?  By the time Christianity became linked with ruling powers, the official church seemed less concerned with experiencing the transformative power of the Risen Jesus and focused more on what you actually believed about Jesus.  Creeds, along with this ancient Trinitarian wording, “Father, Son and Holy Ghost” became the shorthand poetic language used to talk about God-in-the-world and the God-Jesus-Spirit Three-in-one connection.  \\n\\tBut creeds tend to divide and even exclude people. Are they useful at all today?  One of our United Church of Christ treasures is church historian and author, Barbara Brown Zigmund.  She has helped me understand that this Trinity metaphor of God as creator, redeemer and sustainer describes God as “one God existing in community.”  The Trinity speaks of how “God embodies the very nature of reality as relational and communal” (Barbara Brown Zigmund, Christian Century, 4/15/87).  Is this ancient notion of the Trinity another way of saying: everything is connected? She starts to sound like a quantum physicist!  But I hear that same relational and communal aspect of God in today’s reading from Book of Proverbs:  Wisdom, a feminine noun in the original Hebrew, was there with God at the beginning of time.  Wisdom, as the divine feminine spirit of God?  Partner with God?  There may be more “we-ness” to God than we think.  “Let us create humans in our image,” God speaks in Genesis, “male and female let us create them.” BBZ’s point is that “we are all connected…and God is a part of that precious connectedness.”   We get this, don’t we, when we speak of connections between people as being so important to us in this congregation?\\nAs he was saying goodbye, Jesus reassured his followers that “the Spirit of truth” would come to them and guide them in all truth. Even in the midst of transitions and changes that are unsettling and make us anxious. Once again, we find Jesus grappling with simple words that describe a great mystery:  this aspect of the divine that has been present at the beginning of creation is with you always!  This Spirit, this Comforter and Advocate, surrounding and within and uniting all of us.  But how to imagine this?  I need some visuals! \\n\\tSometimes I see in my mind’s eye billions of thin filaments like fiber-optic cable, running from God to each of us and between us, weaving a web of sparking connection among all things.  Sometimes I imagine a vast cloud, an ether, filled with particles of insight, flowing between God and humans.  A relational network: humming, vibrating, connecting us.  Crackling energy of a relational community of God, within God the Creator, Jesus the son and the Holy Spirit.  And all this energy flowing out over and among us.\\nSort of like a relational overflow!  We get chances to practice seeing this everyday. The next time you gaze into someone else’s eyes, or look up into a tree, plunge your hands into damp earth or stare at the stars: picture the vibrating connections of this loving universal force, God-self crackling back and forth.    Proverbs describes God and Wisdom as constantly “rejoicing in God’s inhabited world and delighting in the human race.”  Even as we make a mess of our world, our families, our church our personal lives, God delights in the human race.  \\n\\tAbout 600 years ago, a Russian Orthodox monk named Andrei Rublev tried to visualize this idea of the Holy Trinity.  It was during a time of great political unrest, violence and danger in their native land.  Rublev was aware that amidst the turmoil and fear of their times, words were failing him and his fellow monks.  The monks under his charge just could not bear to hear more words, so he created a special kind of devotional painting known as an icon for his fellow monks.  An icon is created for the viewer to look through, like a window.  A window through which we can encounter new aspects of the divine.  As if to say:  If we are visually able, when words fail us and feelings overwhelm us, we can still see.  We can still gaze.   (Richard Rohr’s book about the Trinity, The Divine Dance)  There is a reproduction of Rublev’s icon on the front page of our Order of Service.   Gaze with me for a moment.\\n\\tLet your eyes wander over these three beings in this icon.  Notice how their long, lean bodies are a bit gender-bending: are they male figures? Their faces might be those of identical sisters.   Each one has wings, robes of differing colors, and is holding a thin staff, as if to suggest they are each on a journey.  Yet they are seated around a table-like structure, with some kind of bowl or chalice between them.   Who are they?  People? Angels?  Rublev knew the story of the early Jewish patriarch and matriarch, Abraham and Sarah.  In the Book of Genesis, we learn that God had led the couple and their extended family out of their homeland, with a promise God’s presence, of new land and offspring.  But in their old age the couple remained childless.   One day, Abraham notices three strangers – angels? – approaching their tents near the oak of Mamre.  He invites them to table, where the couple feeds them, as one does with the unexpected sojourner in one’s midst.  The mysterious strangers have a message for the couple:  you are going to have a child.  What Rublev noticed in the Biblical story is that at this point Abraham starts to address the three messengers as a single entity – as Lord.  God in three persons?   Rublev paints this scene of the three angelic messengers, gathered around the table sharing a meal, as a symbol of three-in-one: the Holy Trinity of God as Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.   The Persons of the Holy Trinity metaphorically hanging around gazing on each other, grooving in each other’s presence.  \\n\\tNotice how the three figures incline their heads to one another.  With quiet humbleness, their eyes are on one another.  Tender affection flowing between the different aspects of God?  Relational energy of both love and curiosity moving between them?  For Rublev, the figure on the left represents God the Creator, divine parent, dressed in an almost irredescent flowing robe.  In the center is Jesus, with dense colors of blue and red, his two outstretched fingers signifying both his human and divine nature.  And to the right, the Holy Spirit, outfitted in earthy, life-giving green.  I am drawn in as I gaze on this icon….for a reason.  Art historians note that “the three figures are not part of a disappearing plane, with a vanishing point in the distance, but rather seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  (p. 133, Rohr).\\n\\tAh, that is it!  There is a fourth figure in this circle of attentive gazing, and that is the viewer.  It is you.  It is me.  The three figures “seem to move ever closer to the person before the icon.”  We are at the table with these three, declared Rublev, we are part of this circle of attentiveness, of quietly animated interaction.  We are part of this exchange of mutual knowing and loving.\\n\\tSpend some time gazing at this image this week; take your place at this table.  Find other marvels to hold your gaze: lake, sky, forest, animals, people. May our contemplation remind of us of our place within this vibrant, crackling energy of God the Creator, Redeemer and Sustainer.  I believe this gazing practice can give us the inspiration, the energy to keep taking risks.  It can allow us to continue to be church when it is unclear who will be here or what will happen next.  Risking to come together as the faith community so we can experience this spilling over, synapse-snapping overflow of God more intimately.  So we can be propelled out by the Spirit of Truth, empowered to serve in the world.  Amen.',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nGOD’S GOOD PLEASURE\\n\\n\\tI wonder how this phrase “God’s good pleasure” resonates with you this morning.  Jesus told his followers that it was “God’s good pleasure to give you the kingdom.”   Maybe there is something in this promise that tells us what Jesus thought about God:  that God is pleased, that God desires, to give us something precious.  Take a moment and think about how you picture God in your imagination: as Someone, Something who takes pleasure in interacting with you?  Or does God seem mostly stingey, or grumpy or disapproving or just passively non-involved with you?  Jesus appears to have experienced God much differently: As a mysterious, loving, intimate entity addressed as Father, Parent.  Who dwells within, and without.  Everywhere.  A Being that takes pleasure in our transformation and our individual well-being.  But what in the world did Jesus mean that God wants to give us the Kingdom?  \\nThis Kingdom language goes way back to what we call the Old Testament times, in a period when Jews had moved beyond looking directly to God and the Torah law for leadership.  Originally, “God alone was their leader; they were to be different from other nations and empires in Mesopotamia.” (Walter Wink). And within that covenant agreement, they agreed to follow God’s laws which taught an unusual sharing of power and resources among the people. But eventually there were kings put in place, with armies to raise and tribute to collect.  Many of them, along with the powerful elite, ruled out of what we might call their own ego needs.  They refused to rule under the direction of God’s Torah, their holy Law:  As Isaiah decribes, the royal court and wealthy merchants did not do good, seek justice, rescue the oppressed, defend the orphans and widows.  Isaiah claimed it weakened them as a nation, making them vulnerable, over and over, to invasions by foreign powers.  We might say, as a nation, their “glass” definitely looked half-empty at this point  Beginning about the mid-second century before Jesus birth, Biblical writers came up with a unique version of is our life together “half empty or half full?”  The Jewish community started claiming that the glass of human history was actually “cracked” and desperately in need of repair.  \\nAccording to Biblical scholar John Dominic Crossan, around the 2nd century BCE, Biblical writers started to describe how, in a time to come, “the God of heaven will set up a kingdom (on earth) that will never be destroyed.”  Our current and treasured divisions between politics and religion are frankly too simplistic to understand how they envisioned the cracks in the glass being mended, world being healed.  God’s kingdom wouldn’t quite be a place, it was more a verb – God’s reigning in a different manner than corrupt human rulers.  It would involve everything: government, the economy, religious institutions, all of society.  Tikkun olam, the Jews called it in Hebrew.  To heal the world.  And Jesus picks up on this as he begins to teach.  “God wants you to have this Kingdom, this reigning of peace and justice and mercy.”\\nIn today’s passage from Luke, Jesus talking about our fears, where our security lies and what it means that this Kingdom of God is at hand.  I think both the Luke and Isaiah passages circle around the challenge of creating a just and peaceful world, be it the larger national scene or closer-to-home scene of this church, and our own inner well-being.  I suggest we consider these two scripture passages through the lens of a current conversation we’re having here at our church about what it means tobe a Just Peace church.  This is a designation created by the United Church of Christ over 30 years ago as a witness to “the interrelation of friendship, justice, and common security from violence.” Two Sundays ago, a group of about 16 of you joined me and Jeff Kern after worship for discussion about our church’s history as a Just Peace Church.  We remembered how your former pastor, Ben Crosby, had been so inspired by his participation in the national gathering of the United Church of Christ in the summer of 1987, where the denomination proclaimed itself as a Just Peace Church, that he came back here and introduced the concept of “Just Peace” to this congregation.  Emerging during the Cold War years of the arms race with the Soviet Union, the concept of a “Just Peace” was developed as an alternative to the idea of “Just War.”  Just War theory has a long tradition in Christian history and was originally seen as a corrective to the extremes of crusades or of total pacifism.  Considering whether a war was just or not was a means by which people of faith would rationally consider their country’s involvement in the violence of war, given the Biblical imperative to not kill each other.  Briefly, a Just War would be one that met certain requirements, including, the military force is justified to defend innocent people and moral values, and the force is enacted ethically.   Just Peace was a recognition that you could have an enforced peace, such as that in the Soviet Union at the time, but it may not necessarily be just, honoring the equity and rights of all people.\\nThe Just Peace pronouncement developed at the General Synod gathering that your pastor Ben Crosby attended, was really a vision of what the Kingdom of God looks like.   Is the vote of this congregation in 1987 to become a Just Peace church still meaningful to your life together as a congregation?  What kind of new or re-vitalized social justice and outreach initiatives might we engage to live out that important legacy here?  During the 1980’s this call went out to UCC churches across the land, encouraging us to consider the wider, systemic violence in the challenging justice issues of the day: racism, environmental degradation, food insecurity, lack of access to proper healthcare/education/housing/jobs, to name a few.  UCC churches across the country debated their role in society.  This congregation decided to explore how these injustices could be acknowledged and confronted non-violently.  Do we simply try and help directly feed, house and comfort people, or do we also try and figure out and change the systems that cause certain people to be hungry, unsheltered and mistreated?   Isaiah would say, some 1800 years earlier, this is doing good, working to see that God’s peace, God’s shalom, extended to all humankind.  This local church decided to grapple with this wide umbrella of Just Peace through the years, seeking to do both charity and justice work that would help change unjust systems.  Letter writing on behalf of the hunger organization Bread for the World, yearly support of a shrimp boil dinner raising funds for the justice work with impoverished communities on the Gulf Coast through Back Bay Mission.   And the trips and exchanges with a community in the region of Chiapas, Mexico.  These were never simply a mission trip “to go help people so we feel good about being helpers.” Personal relationships were built between people in this church and one Catholic parish, its priest, his staff and parishioners in the small town of Amantanango, outside of San Cristobal.  In addition, connections were made with UCC world mission staff working with Guatamalean refugees flowing into Mexico at the time.  These impoverished Mexican communities were the leaders in these relationships, informing this church what they needed.  And this church responded and people came back home here to tell the stories of what they experienced and how they were personally changed by these encounters.   This is a powerful legacy, in my mind, of how one lives out being a Just Peace church.  I wonder where a renewed commitment to this legacy might lead us next?\\t\\n\\tSo what did Jesus mean by “the Kingdom of God?  A reign of Just Peace, where there is equity and well-being for all.  Jesus was not just talking about some interior moral kingdom in our hearts. Yes, he taught that “the KOG is within you,” an animating force already inside of us.  And Jesus also described an outer world in which equality and fairness and compassion rule.   Which says a lot about how we are to act with one another as Just Peace church.  Hostility and blaming has no place among us as a Just Peace congregation.  Disagreements, yes.  Conflict over things that matter? Bring it on!  But our interactions will be done with respect, empathy and openness.  Finally, this just peaceness among us can’t wait.  Consider the urgency in Jesus’ parable of the master coming home and needing to find that the servants are ready and waiting.  Attentiveness, diligence is needed as we learn to become kingdom partners with God.  God yearns for us to collaborate with God, to partner with God’s good pleasure. Let’s keep talking about what this might look like among us. Amen.\\n\\n\\t',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nGOD WORKS TOGETHER FOR GOOD\\n\\n\\tHere we are on History Sunday, perhaps wondering how God’s spirit might be praying inside of each of us.  The early apostle Paul wrote these words of encouragement to his friends in the new and conflicted church in Rome, mid first century.  As we hear the portion of his letter, we might find ourselves questioning: given all that has happened in our congregation over the last few years, and stretching back to other church conflicts here, do “all things really work together for good?”   How is it that God might somehow be using all the misunderstandings, disagreements, unresolved conflicts, betrayals, hurts and bewilderment that have been experienced by some in this congregation…and is working them together for good?\\n\\tI am not saying that I think God caused all these things to happen.  I don’t imagine that God sits at a giant control panel in the sky, like a at big computer and planning awful things to happen in our lives.  “Here, let me send as earthquake, or make someone sick, or I’ll start messy church conflict over here,” But we live in an imperfect world, where mistakes are made, disasters happen and people hurt each other.   What is the way IN for us to consider that God is working this situation for the good?\\n\\tI think we have a beginning opportunity today, as we share the joys and challenges, the blessings and disappointments, of being part of this church together over the years.  We may even find that in spite of different experiences and different points of view, we probably have all experienced some loss.  Loss of a trusted and beloved pastor OR loss of a chance to have a pastor you respected.   Loss of a way the church was in years past, loss of fellow members and friends who have left, loss of an anticipated future as a vibrant, growing congregation.  Loss of people in our pews who have died.  Perhaps we can each begin to acknowledge that ALL have lost something, and, that we do share that experience in common.  Knowing someone else is grieving has a way of softening my own heart, if I can sit quiet and just listen.  I’m reminded of the losses in my own life, and if I am brave enough and willing, I get another chance to embrace my own experiences and feelings in a new way.  We get to do this In the companionship of fellow traveler, on this journey where change and disappointment and loss are part of the life God offers us.  \\nIn a few moments, as you gather in small groups and begin listening carefully to one another, be aware of the losses that are being shared.  Be in solidarity with one another, not because you agree about the facts as described, who=did-or-said-what, but because we all share the common bond of loss.  In that sharing, we may begin to notion God’s Spirit praying within us with sighs too deep for words.  We may begin to see how God is working at renewing, refashioning and rebuilding us as a church.  We get to be partners with God in this healing process or God working all things for good among us.  Thanks be to God.  Amen. \\n ',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tLuke 16:1-13\\n\\n\\nTHE ECONOMY OF FAITH\\n\\nThis passage from Luke contains one of Jesus’ stranger stories.  It comes after the more understandable parables of the lost sheep, lost coin and the prodigal son story of a lost father-son relationship.  Is this a lost job story?  A tale of scrambling to save your lost prestige in the community?  A parable of loosing your honesty and getting praised for your shrewdness?  I’m part of a local pastors group that meets for scripture study each week.  We had a heck of a time trying to figure out what on earth Jesus was getting at.  So, let’s see what we can make of it!  Context: Jesus has been responding to the Pharisees, the Jewish legal scholars, who are harassing Jesus because he hangs out with tax collectors, sinners who break Jewish law and other marginalized people.  Instead of directly challenging people, Jesus often tells a parable.  These little stories are meant to unsettle people’s assumptions.  Give them a glimpse of the Kingdom, the Reign of God, from the perspective of God’s peculiar logic (David Lose phrase).  For starters, we might want to listen for the peculiar, the unexpected, the reversal of what we might expect.  \\n \\t “There was a rich man,” Jesus begins and everyone in the vicinity perks up.  (Apparently, fascination with the lives of the rich and famous is as old as the hills.)    And a rumor goes around that his estate manager has cheated him.  He confronts the manger and fires him…… But before the manger is released from his duties, he runs around trying to make good with his bosses debtors.  Interest rates were high and the manger appears to cut what people owe the manger, down to their original debt, cutting out interest due the master.  To secure his own future now that he no longer has a job?  He is eventually praised by the master for making friends by means of dishonest wealth.  This parable has confounded esteemed Biblical scholars down through the ages.  As I wrestled with the text, I was snagged on this last part about the impossibility of serving both God and wealth.  Is this a parable about who and what are we willing to serve in the normal transactions of our lives?  I found myself humming a snippet of a tune, repeating a refrain I couldn’t quite place:  “you gotta serve somebody” round and round in my head. Thank goodness for Internet search engines; there it was:\\nYou may be an ambassador to England or France,\\n\\nYou may like to gamble, you might like to dance,\\n\\nYou may be the heavyweight champion of the world,\\n\\nYou may be a socialite with a long string of pearls\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed\\n                     \\nYou're gonna have to serve somebody,\\n      \\nWell, it may be the devil or it may be the Lord\\n                         \\nBut you're gonna have to serve somebody.\\n\\nBob Dylan in the late 1970’s, echoing, probably unintentionally, this ancient Biblical story about ultimate allegiance which guides daily decisions.   Uncannily, Dylan hits the issue spot-on:  Whoever you are, you end up sometimes unwittingly serving evil or good.  You don’t believe you have to chose? Dylan taunts.  Think again. \\n\\tWhat do our daily choices say about whom or what we serve?  What would my life really look like, or your life, if we could say “I serve God.” ?  Or put in specifically Christian terms: “I follow the Way of Jesus, that is how I serve God.” ?  Not just our dollars but what does our attention, our time, our daydreams, our appetites, our energies, our hopes actually serve?   It’s so everyday, this choice-making; it is easy to loose track of how “who we serve” is played out in our daily lives, choice by choice.  \\n\\t  Within the Hebrew language scriptures of Jesus’ time, there were various messages about money, wealth and poverty.  Faithfulness meant being generous.  The whole society was to take care of those living in poverty among them, the orphans, the widows, the needy in their midst.  It was considered a “mitzvah” or a blessing to do so.  Here’s why the prophet Amos is so critical of those who cheated the poor, who altered the weighing scales in the market so folks were ripped-off when their grain is measured out.     Not just individuals were to be generous and just; this was the job of the whole society to be fair and just.  Uncomfortable reminders for us, in a time when economic disparity between the rich and the poor in this country is one of the causes of the vitriolic polarization across our nation.  Amos’ words cut into us, as we think about the huge disparities in access to proper health care, good schools, clean drinking water, fair-wage jobs, adequate housing.  \\t \\nBut Jesus’ story seems to careen off into an unexpected affirmation of shrewdness and dishonesty.  The manager proceeds to collect from several of his boss’s debtors, probably by reducing the interest money he as manager could receive and thereby remaining friends with his neighbors.  He is praised by the rich boss because of his ability to wisely read the situation he finds himself in and do something about it, and make his master look generous at the same time.\\nI can just picture the disciples looking at each other in confusion.  The previous stories about the lost were Jesus’ response to the charge that he consorted with sinners.  This story appears to be about sin that involves money, and the ongoing challenge of serving two masters, having both God and money in your life.  But what is Jesus doing here?  \\n\\tIn keeping with his own Jewishness, Jesus did not appear to think money was evil.  But it did teach that the use of money was as morally complicated. Jesus had an uncanny way of revealing that, as one Biblical commentator has noted, “how we relate to money is a barometer of how we relate to God.”  (Don Clendenin, 17C Blog)  The way I relate to money, the way I think about, worry about money and the way I handle my finances is a kind of measure of the mood, the atmospheric pressure we could say, between me and God.   Ouch.\\n\\tHere’s an another translation of Jesus’ comment at the end of the story:  “make friends for yourselves by means of worldly wealth so that when it is gone, the children of this age, may welcome you into their eternal tents” (is the actual translation).  Tents, not home; life on the move in God’s Kingdom, where one’s treasured position and possessions can change in a flash.  Maybe Jesus is pushing us to see that our very security lies elsewhere.  Could it be that the dishonest manager is praised because, in a crisis, he reaches out below himself, to those in debt to his boss?  In what way might connections between us and those on other rungs of the financial ladder be shrewd or wise?  Is Jesus reminding us that the rich and the poor are more connected then they know?  That our financial status can be fleeting, and we need to be careful not to cling to it?  Jesus speaks of life in a tent rather than a building like a home; unpredictable, ready to pick up and move as the Spirit leads.  Lots of questions to consider this week.  \\n\\tEach of our financial situations is different, but I invite us to keep re-visiting this text and see where it leads us this week.  As we handle our cash, write a check, take out a debit or credit card, let’s wonder about what makes us feel secure.  In what ways do we serve this notion of security; just who or what do we actually serve? Jesus is pretty blunt at the end of this passage.  We cannot serve God and wealth.   Most of us have not taken monastic vows of poverty; most of us are neither destitute nor extraordinarily wealthy.  We’re muddling through all this along some kind of middle way.  Jesus invites us to wonder and question about money, the possibilities and the challenges it brings to each of us.  And so might we pray and ponder in the days ahead.  Because “we're gonna have to serve somebody, yes indeed we're gonna have to serve somebody,  Amen. \\n\",\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nREMEMBERING WHOSE WE ARE\\n\\n\\tSeveral years ago now, I was serving as the interim pastor in a church in suburban Washington DC.  I remember a woman there describing an experience she had just had with one of her grandchildren.  She and her young grandson were spending the day together during an unexpected school snow-day. Somehow they had gotten on the topic of money, more specifically “currencies” – this is with a 6 year old, mind you.   After some discussion about how different countries have different types of currencies (dollars, the yen, euros, pesos and such), this 21st century child decided to create some credit cards and debits cards.  Our current currency of choice, at least the one obvious to most children as they watch parents pay for things in stores and restaurants.  As they played together with the various pretend credit and debit cards, the child announced it was time to make a “worship card.”  “Hmmmm…that’s interesting,” said grandmother.  “Just what does a worship card do?”  “Well, you can use it to get things, like you can buy goats to send for Heifer project like we do at church” replied the child confidently, “you can get food for poor people with it.”   Apparently a loaded “worship card” can make good things happen and it is about getting things for other people.\\n\\tHearing this story, I wondered: how might a “worship card” might function?  This young boy may be on to something important about communal life together as a church, and perhaps this will help us understand our sacrament of baptism a bit better.  Any “plastic” has to have something loaded on it, cash in the bank or available credit, for it to be worth anything.   I suggest that a “loaded” worship card can do more than we know.  It provides certain value:  spiritual, intellectual and emotional currency, that, for starters, enables us to make life choices based on our values and beliefs.   But just what is it that gets loaded up on our internal “worship card” when we participate in Sunday mornings together?   Shifting the analogy a bit, is worship simply a spiritual Holiday station where we dip in for a quart of intellectual stimulation and a loaf of “feel good” inspiration?  Are we just privately “tanking up” when we come here?   Not according to one of the 6 year olds in my northern Virginia congregation!\\n\\tEach month in our newsletter, I describe our weekly worship as “the heart of our life together” here at First Congregational UCC.  In worship, we learn more about God and we learn more about the needs of the world, so we can go out and help heal God’s creation.   But I also think that one of the most important things that gets loaded up on our “worship card” is a deeper understanding about ourselves.  And this changed perspective about ourselves eventually starts to make a real difference in our lives.\\n\\tOur Biblical forebearers spent a lot of time asking God to clarify their current situation:  “are you still with us? they would demand of God during difficult times.  Who are we to you, chopped liver?”  In their worship and in their sacred writings, the community would recount where they had been and what it had meant:  Released from slavery in Egypt, given a new land so they could become a light of justice and compassion to all nations.  As followers of Jesus, we stand within this tradition of those who would look back and remind themselves of God’s claim on them.  Now the Bible is full of stories of people not living up to God’s intentions, yet they keep claiming whose they are.  As part of this family line, we are invited to see ourselves in today’s words from the prophet Isaiah:  we have been taken by and kept by God, we too have been given a covenant to be that Light and to open the eyes of the blind, release the prisioners.  Why?  Because God is always doing a new thing, and we are to be part of it because of who we are as God’s children.  \\t\\n\\tWhy does this matter?  Because the world so often tells us otherwise.  Our media tells us we are important if we look a certain way, are a certain age and own certain things.  Bosses tell us we matter based on our productivity.  Who are we; whose are we?  Are we owned by our work, our hobbies, our volunteering, or by our debts, our past failures or mistakes?  We come to worship and we hear a different message:  we are reminded that we are created, formed, redeemed, owned by God.  According to the prophet Isaiah, writing during the horrendous time of Israel’s capture and exile, we are each called by name:  “you are mine,” says God.   Whose are you, Anne?  Who names and claims you?  Well, I come from the Swallow clan, hardy New England stock, married into the Gillis clan, lived in a lot of places, sure do like to think that I own myself, have autonomy over myself, if I’m really honest.  Empowered and independent, I am! Don’t nobody own me! \\t\\n\\tBut scripture seems to indicate otherwise:  “Anne, you are not your own.  Your are mine, says God.”  We each are God’s off-spring, God’s children, sons, daughters of the living God.  When we celebrate the sacrament of Communion each month, we are enacting this sign of God with us in community, the Spirit of the Living Christ in our midst at the Table.  When we baptize our little babies and our adults in the sacrament of baptism, we affirm that they are God’s children, and we promise to be as family to them in their faith formation.   When you and I worship together, Sunday after Sunday, we are loading up this identity awareness on our “worship card.”\\nI have sometimes wondered what Jesus’ memories of his baptism in the River Jordan.  John the Baptist invited fellow Jews to publically step up and repent, to turn their life around and be baptized in recognition of the forgiveness of their sins. We have no idea what suddenly drew Jesus to do this outdoor ritual, to emerge from an obscure young adulthood, and align himself with a radical prophet who was already in trouble with the local authorities.  Did Jesus bring a sense of his own shortcomings, his own hesitancies, up to that point?  Could he have possibly have been feeling spiritually dry himself?   Desiring to turn his life around, was he seeking to quench some deeper thirst in those river waters.  Did he hope to ritually engage his past and his future as he entered into a dramatically public and dangerous path of teaching and healing?  Did memory of his baptism bring him comfort and courage as he faced rejection and eventual persecution, torture and death?  Here is someone who so clearly was able to convince other people of their essential worth and loveableness.  At the River Jordan, did Jesus come to recognize himself as worthy, loved and intimately connected to God.  Matthew says he heard the words from heaven: “This is my beloved son, in whom I am well pleased.”  Perhaps the question for each of us is similar:  Do we know ourselves to belong to God, to be beloved sons and daughters?  Do we truly experience that God is pleased with us?\\n\\tEach week when we come to worship we come as a slightly different person.  We may bring a new awareness of our gratefulness, a deeper sense of our need to forgive someone, some increasing anxiety or fear, a growing sense that we need to be accountable for an area of neglect or wrongdoing in our lives.  It’s hard to admit this stuff; we don’t want to seem weak or dependent.  But ultimately, what guides our lives?  The world? Or God?  The rigors of Christian life, with the constant call to self-honesty, generosity, openness and inclusivity, can be overwhelming.   We worship together and load up our “worship card” as we remember whose we are.  We boldly say we are identified individually, named, by the Mysterious Creator of the Universe, and that this reality lays claim on us.  Slowly, over weeks and months, our consciousness is transformed, our souls are awakened.   We load up our worship card with this empowered awareness.  And then we once again head out into the world, to live and serve in Jesus’ name. Thanks be to God.  Amen.\\n\\n',\n",

Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\n\\nMATTHEW TELLS ABOUT JESUS\\n\\n\\tGreetings and peace to you, in the name of Jesus the Christ!  My name is Matthew and I come to you from the distant first century world to tell you about why Jesus was born!   I’ve been visiting around your town the last few days and noticing nativity scenes springing up, outside churches and in smaller creches in your homes.  I love how you 21st century people have woven parts of my version of the birth story with the Gospel writer’s Luke’s version in your manger scenes!  What?!  There are two birth stories about Jesus?  Ah…..that’s why Pastor Anne invited me today….I hear she invited Mark to speak last week, but for some reason he didn’t include any of these great stories in his gospel.  So today you get to hear more about these birth stories….and maybe see where you might fit into them.  \\n\\tI never met Jesus in person.  Does that surprise you?  Church tradition has said that the authors of Matthew Mark Luke and John were all disciples of Jesus.  Uh….not possible.  Jesus was arrested and killed before most of us were born!  But so many stories about him and his teachings were passed down by his family, by his friends after the Jesus kept reappearing after they thought he was dead.  Those who started to follow his Way treasured his teachings and healing stories and remembered them. Then people started to write them down, but not until decades after he died!  I read Mark’s gospel by the way, and filched about 95% of his material…..and then added some of my own from other sources that unknown to the Biblical scholars!  But here’s the thing: what we all wrote about Jesus was NOT meant to be an eyewitness account, like a journalist might write in the newspaper or on-line today.  We were doing something else.  See, as we were each writing our Gospels, we were experiencing the presence of the Risen Jesus Christ in our midst of our faith communities!  Jesus wasn’t someone who just lived long ago.  The Risen Jesus Christ, Hebrew for Messiah, was an active presence in our life together.  Our relationship with his living spirit was challenging and changing us everyday!  The other gospel writers and I were trying to describe this reality, something so huge, we often had to resort to metaphor, poetry, symbolic language.  I have heard that your Native American storytellers say, “this may not be exactly how it happened, but I know that it is true.”  Like any really important story, we were trying to give you the bigger picture….of something that really was quite amazing and even mysterious.  Why was Jesus born?  What was God up to here?  Why did Jesus have such a powerful effect on people?  \\n\\tThrough the style of my writings, and the events I refer to, Biblical scholars figure I wrote my book in around 80 or 90 CE.  They can also tell that I am a Jewish, Greek speaking, Christian. I lived in Antioch, on the border of present day Turkey and Syria.  Busy cosmopolitan area, on the ancient Silk Route, and was filled with both Jewish and Gentile converts to Christianity.  But I am Jewish in origin; some people think I was a Pharisee, an expert on Jewish law, Torah and how to apply it to everyday life.  I wrote this gospel to say that “this man Jesus is the one we, the Jewish community, have been waiting for all these years…this is the Messiah….the one who will come to save Israel.” That’s why I quote the Hebrew scriptures, what you call the Old Testament, so much throughout my book. I wanted to remind my people to know that God was still doing mighty works and divine disclosures in their midst.\\n\\tWhen I tell this to modern day churches, some people say they are wary of sounding so presumptuous; they hesitate to say God is doing this or that in their midst.  I tell them: Oh, come on! Don’t be so tentative and polite!  You are not running a civic organization or a social fraternity, this is the Body of Christ here at the corner of West 2nd and _____3rd!  Claim God’s mighty works in your midst! The gradual healing following painful conflict, the signs of forgiveness and revitalized ministries that goes on in the midst this place…..claim it!  I hear that you are learning from your history, you’re discerning what God is calling this church to next, getting clear about your values, shared beliefs and vision, setting priorities about what God wants you to do next, and pledging financial resources towards that future.    How wonderfully bold and risky of all of you!\\n\\tWhat I love about the Jesus’ birth story is that God seems to use all kinds of everyday people who are wiling to do bold and risky things.   To illustrate this, I do include some extravagant details in my birth narrative, I must say.  Careful not to get caught up in a literal interpretation; you’ll miss the point.  All these colorful details have important symbolic meaning. Angels!  Wild dreams! Unlikely parents!   Long journey and miraculous birth! A star!  Exotic wise men from the East!  A wicked king!  Action, camera – is that how you say it?!  Actually, only Luke and I include details of Jesus’ birth in our gospels.  We both believe that the most important moment in Jesus’ earthly life, when he actually became the Son of God, was at his conception.   But instead of dwelling on Mary, like Luke does, I focus my story Joseph, the brave Jewish man who becomes Jesus’ earthly father. \\nBut was Joseph actually Jesus’ father?  Hmmmmm…… Did you know that in my time, Jewish law dictated that paternity was based on the man’s acknowledgement of the child?  If a man takes his betrothed to live in his parent’s home (the final stage of getting married) and assumes responsibility for a mother and a child, he is the father.  If a man goes so far as to name a child, as the angel directed Joseph to do, the man was acknowledging that baby as his own.  Now any one of you who have adopted a child, or served as a step-parent, will know what I am talking about.  I guess I really admired Joseph, being that he could have simply divorced Mary without a lot of fuss.  But he sensed that God was calling him to more than just familiar legal requirements.  God was asking him to take a risk and make a decision before all the information was there.  Come to think of it, I guess this happens to all of us, sometimes, doesn’t it?  We feel we have to take a risk and make a decision before we know all of the consequences.  As a church, you all have to start trusting each other again before there is evidence this is a good idea!  You will eventually choose a new pastor to be your preacher and teacher, but you will not know this person fully.  I hear you a putting some new policies in place to better help you navigate life together as a congregation.  But who knows what will happen next?  Risky business, this Jesus stuff, I must say.  \\n\\tBefore I go, I have to mention those strange people who came from the east to visit Jesus in Bethlehem.  And what about this awful King Herod?  Pastor Anne will tell you more about why I included this cruel puppet ruler of the Roman occupiers, during her January 5 sermon celebrating the Feast of Epiphany.  But the star, I have to tell you about this really cool detail!  In ancient times, important people’s birth was often heralded by an astronomical surprise: a comet’s sudden appearance, the alignment of two planets in a blazing orb.  I meant for these exotic visitors to remind people of Zoroastrian priests from Persia, who had a special group of starwatchers called the magi.  For my congregation at the end of the first century, folks like this were considered definitely outside the fold.  See, my church community was starting to welcome new people into its midst, like Greek speaking gentiles that we Jewish folks didn’t really know or understand at first.  But the magi were some of the first to recognize who Jesus was!  \\n\\tI wanted to show and inspire my own people how humble, fallible and unexpected folks can take risks to be part of God’s work in the world.  Hopefully this inspires you too!  I’m glad you still read my birth stories about how seemingly insignificant people can end up playing huge roles in God’s intentions.  Think about that next time you feel insignificant or like you have made some bad mistakes in your life. It’s true you know, God can work through any of us.   \\t \\t\\n  hiWhat a pleasure to time-travel and speak with you today.  A blessed Advent to you!  Amen.\\n\\t   hi',\n",
       " 'March 22, 2020 \\t\\t\\t\\t\\tLent 4A\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tJohn 9:1-17\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tVirtual Worship\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\n\\nPATCHES OF GOD-LIGHT\\n\\n\\tOne might think this story is pretty straight forward:  A guy is blind and Jesus heals him.  But this simple compassionate act kicks up all sorts of heated debate. It includes not just the man formerly known as “Blind Beggar,” but also Jesus’ disciples, the local religious scholars the Pharisees, and even the man’s parents.  Jesus has entered Jerusalem with his disciples, to celebrate a Jewish Festival of Booths.  An annual holy time commemorating God’s protection of Israelites during the Exodus from Egypt and their time wandering in the wilderness.  The city is teeming with visitors, there to participate in eight days of solemn worship and animal sacrifices in the Temple, ritual processions through the streets with music, sacred dancing, waving branches.  During this religious festival, the Temple priests would process to pool of Siloam for holy water to pour over the Temple altar.  Four huge lampstands would be lit in the Temple to symbolize the light of God.   Water and light, each carrying a visible sign of the invisible mystery of God.  \\nIn the middle of all this, Jesus spots this blind man.  After some back and forth with his followers about just why this man might be blind, Jesus stops talking.  He stoops down, spits on the ground, scoops up some of this muddy mess and without asking, spreads it on the man’s eyes.  “Go wash your eyes in the pool of Siloam,” he tells the man.  “I can see, I can see,” the man cries.  Throughout the ensuing hubbub this healing act causes, Jesus weaves through themes of blindness, seeing, and his being “the light of the world.”   Everyone has different points of view on what it means to be blind, the implications of being healed, and just who this person Jesus really is.   But in the midst of the commotion of jossling pilgrims, the drama of splashing water dousing the Temple altar and the blaze of the giant lampstands, Jesus claims something new about both sight and light.  What do we make of this?\\n\\tAnd what are we to make of this healing story in the middle of a pandemic?  In the middle of this frightening time in our community, our nation and our world when healing from covid-19 seems like a distant fever dream?  How do we consider healing, surviving and getting back to normal when the huge wave of inevitable illness hasn’t visibly reach our community yet?  How will we heal the disruptions in our lives and the anxiety that haunts our dreams in these days?  We are unable to see ahead into an uncertain future. It’s as though a certain blindness has befallen all of us.  We can’t quite perceive what is happening around us.  \\nIn Jesus’ time, blindness was considered a disfigurement and public punishment. It meant you had sinned and were unfit for worship in the Temple or being around other people.  You became an outcast in your community.  Some of this undercurrent exists in our day.  For starters, we’re experiencing various forms of “blaming the victims” with this current worldwide medical emergence.  Our leaders use an outdated racist phrase such as “the China virus.”  We tend to blame travel plans for an individual’s illness.   We become suspicious of one another.\\nAncient Hebrews scriptures did encourage people to have compassion on those who lived with the condition of blindness.  Jewish law instructed them to “invite the blind to your feasts.”   And by the time of the prophets, we find references to the Messianic age where the God of compassion will make the blind to see, release the captives, feed the hungry, bind up the brokenhearted.  The talk of blaming someone for personal misfortune ceases, as the prophets talk about God’s compassionate actions breaking into history, changing corrupt systems and healing community.  Jesus will use these same images to speak of the coming Kingdom of God.  \\nGod made us with vulnerable bodies, but also declared it “good.” Decline and dying is part of our creatureliness.   And here we are, as has happened throughout human history, with an expected but natural emergence of a new and powerful virus that is challenging our bodies’ defenses and our health systems’ preparedness.  And, as never before, we are a world-wide population constantly on the move, inter-connected at a level we never thought possible.   We are befuddled, annoyed and unsettled by these present circumstances.  It is understandable that we each may be having trouble perceiving appropriately.  Much is clouded in uncertainty.\\nPerhaps we are a bit like this cast of characters in today’s story, who were each disrupted and irritated by this physical change in this man, with his change in status from blind to sighted.  Something is new here that just is not visible to them.    They all have different concerns about this healing act and they each have a survival agenda.  People don’t always react well when the way forward is uncertain.  And Jesus wanted God to be glorified.  God to be acknowledged and celebrated in a healing that involved not just body renewal.  The man’s status changed; it opened up his reconnecting and a healing of community ties.  The man is restored to sight AND to his wider community.\\nSo something is afoot for all of us in this pandemic.  We are surrounded by uncertainty and cannot clearly see ahead into the future.  And yet, and yet, God is at work among us.  I’ve been thinking about how the British author, C.S. Lewis, spoke of the simple gifts that can be there in the middle of dark times.  He called them “patches of Godlight in the woods of our experience”  (Letters to Malcolm, p. 120).  Lewis asked: How might our vision be changed so we see not just this present difficulty and loss, but a wider picture.”  I wonder, how will we re-envision community connections and acts of compassion in these days?\\nJesus was not just a healer of bodies.  He wanted us to truly see,“Godlight” all around us.  In acts of compassion, in reframing of what it means to be community.  “Patches of Godlight” will continue to spring up all around us, everyday in the midst of this hot mess, if we will just look.   The Spirit of Jesus, the healer, moves among us, even now, widening our vision of God’s compassionate presence in all that is.  Thanks be to God!  Amen.',\n",
       " 'January 5, 2020\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tEpiphany Sunday\\nFirst Congregational UCC\\t\\t\\t\\tMatthew 2:1-12\\nGrand Marais, MN\\t\\t\\t\\t\\tIsaiah 60:1-6\\nThe Rev. Anne Swallow Gillis\\t\\t\\tHoly Communion\\n\\n\\nThe Challenge of the Magi\\n\\tEpiphany Sunday; the Twelfth Day of Christmas.  This period after Christmas is often a bit disconcerting.  And it’s not just all the dry Christmas tree needles!  Perhaps we feel a mixture of happy and satisfied exhaustion, or maybe we are just relieved that all the hoopla is over. For some of us there may be quiet disappointment; our hopes and expectations for this time were not quite fulfilled.  There is something about Christmas, and winter celebrations in colder climates, which seem to trigger feelings about personal relationships with other humans.  We may find ourselves pondering ways in which we belong to and feel separate from those around us. Our predominant culture has crafted this season with a pervasive advertising theme of “Home for the Holidays.”  We are bombarded with persistent commercial scenes of families and friends smiling and embracing, sharing festive foods and thoughtful gifts.  Which can be lovely, or it can be a very challenging time.  \\n \\tThe Biblical Christmas narrative is easy to miss in the holiday swirl.  It brings such a mix of humble and homely details, as well as extraordinary proclamations of the miraculous.  At times it seems like a rather bizarre ancient story. Our minds grapple intellectually, trying to make theological sense out of the Christmas Mystery, with what we have heard in the texts, the carols, through December.  “O Come, Emmanuel,” our choir sang each Sunday as we began our worship liturgy.  How do we understand this request? Come, Emmanuel, O God-with-us?   God has become with-us, incarnate in Jesus, but how? In what way? And why? What does all this have to do with God and me, we might wonder.  Is there a God and me?  What difference does this make in my life?  The light shines in the darkness and the darkness has not overcome, it calls out the prophetic voice.  What does this mean for me now? we ask ourselves.  What does this mean for our church, now?  What is this revelation of the divine, of the supernatural we might say, in human life?  By the time I get to Epiphany, the 12th day of Christmas, I am again struck by this reality:  you and I don’t get to have sweet baby Jesus for ourselves, tucked around the manger, feeling cozy.  Christian faith is not a private matter, or just about being close to other people. If our Christian values and beliefs, our sense of connection with God through the teachings and living presence of Jesus, aren’t just private or familial, then what?   I think all of this has to do with us being in the world in a totally different way.  \\nMy hunch is that this is why the Gospel of Matthew included the story of the Magi, following a star to Jesus’ birthplace, in his birth stories.  Foreigners, outsiders, non-Jews, probably Persian astronomers who served as a type of high priests in the Zoroastrian religion, arriving from the East.  No other Gospel writer includes this part of the birth story.  \\n“Magi” is a Greek word for wise ones or astrologers, and I think this tale pulls us out of our private, familial and familiar world.  They travel over 1000 miles from far-away, exotic Persia, bringing gifts that foretell both a glorious and somber future for the newborn King.  We hear the echo of the Isaiah prophecy:  gold, for a king; frankincense, the incense burned in the Jewish Temple, its smoke lifting up the prayers of the people; myrrh, the spice associated with burial practices.  Such weird baby gifts!  Political implications arise as the magi encounter the wicked and desperate King Herod.  A fawning puppet ruler indebted to the occupying Roman Imperial power; Herod is panicked at news of a possible rival in this new child.  He ends up massacring all Jewish baby boys in the region in a desperate attempt to stop Jesus’ assumed rise to political power.  Joseph and Mary receive the magi, and the strangers’ curious gifts, only to soon flee Bethlehem after being warned in a dream of Herod’s malicious intent.  \\n\\tBiblical scholars have noted that Matthew’s late first century church included many non-Jewish Gentiles.  Perhaps this magi story was Matthew’s attempt to remind his community that Jesus was connected to non-Jews. There was considerable debate at this time about whether the Jesus Way was simply a reform movement within Judaism, or was it the opening up of the Jewish tradition to outsiders in a new way?  Matthew was trying to show how outsiders from another religion and culture fit into the Jewish Jesus’ story from the very beginning!  Resistance to newcomers who are different from us is not new.\\nThis Epiphany, I’m encountering this magi story from a place of curiosity about the way we resist newcomers, people who are different from us.  I’m increasingly concerned about how this resistance happens within our community locally, our churches, our nation as a whole, and most disturbingly, I am having to notice, within myself.  After our two book discussions this fall, I continue to grapple with understanding our nation’s conflict around strangers among us: our current immigration crisis and the wild variety of reactions to it.  To cope with some of my overwhelm about this situation, I’ve been reading Joanna Macy and Chris Johnstone’s book “Active Hope:  How to Face the Mess We’re in without Going Crazy.”  Joanna Macy is a scholar of Buddhism who has spent many years helping both peace activists and now those working to stem the tide of climate change, to deal with their sense of frustration and despair.  The authors describe ways to acknowledge the pain, grief and hopelessness we feel about the state of the world, while seeing ourselves, each other and our planet in a new light of connectedness.   I’ve found myself wondering how this approach might impact our own working through the mess of pain, grief and even hopelessness regrading past few years of conflict in this congregation.  Reaffirming connectedness and mutually accountability to one another.  \\nThen I noticed in a recent News Herald article about our County Commissioners considering a vote regarding refugees in our county.  This upcoming vote is in response to the Executive directive/order from the President in September regarding local immigration.  The directive asks that elected county leaders across the country vote on whether or not they are welcoming of official refugees, those who have received that designation through a long government vetting process, and to do so by the end of this month.  Our Cook County Commissioners will revisit this at their next meeting on Jan 14. 14. Hmmmmm, I thought.  This is an interesting synchronicity, in my mind.  I plan to attend; anyone willing to join me?  What are the values we hold in common as a church that speak to this issue of welcoming refugees, people different, from us fleeing persecution and needing a new place to start their lives over?\\nJoanna Macy’s challenge about our connectedness comes to mind….seeing the “other” in a new light.  Perhaps the season of Epiphany is letting the Light of Jesus Christ begin to see some things differently.  We are part of a Biblical tradition of radical hospitality to the stranger, to the sojourner in our midst.  This openness and welcome and care for the immigrants and refugees among us was deeply imbedded in middle eastern tradition, and hugely reinforced in the teachings of Jesus. The welcoming of immigrants and refugees also has been an important part of our history as a nation, although there have been times when exclusionary racist views have kept people of color and people of different religions from being included in that welcome, be they anyone looking vaguely Asian, or people of color or non-Protestant Christians. How welcoming do we want to be as a nation, as a community, as a church?  What might this radical form of Biblical hospitality require of us in this time? \\nAs we struggle to make sense of the Christmas mystery, I suggest we continue to soak in these stories.  Today, a tales of strangers bringing news of a new born king.  This possibility that we are all welcome into God’s embrace, even when we feel far off.  We are all bathed in this Light, even as we encounter darkness is so much of our lives and the world around us.  We are called to reflect this Light out into the world in new ways.  Amen.']"
